As the oil and gas industry is gradually shifting toward intelligence and digitalization, many large oil and gas companies were working on blockchain technology in the past two years because of it can significantly improve the management level, efficiency, and data security of the oil and gas industry. This paper aims to let more people in the oil and gas industry understand the blockchain and lead more thinking about how to apply the blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest papers on the review of the blockchain system in the oil and gas industry. This paper first presents the relevant theories and core technologies of the blockchain, and then describes how the blockchain is applied to the oil and gas industry from four aspects: trading, management and decision making, supervision, and cyber security. Finally, the application status, the understanding level of the blockchain in the oil and gas industry, opportunities, challenges, and risks and development trends are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) at present, Europe and Asia have the fastest pace of developing the application of blockchain in the oil and gas industry, but there are still few oil and gas blockchain projects in operation or testing worldwide; 2) nowadays, the understanding of blockchain in the oil and gas industry is not sufficiently enough, the application is still in the experimental stage, and the investment is not enough; and (3) blockchain can bring many opportunities to the oil and gas industry, such as reducing transaction costs and improving transparency and efficiency. However, since it is still in the early stage of the application, there are still many challenges, primarily technological, and regulatory and system transformation. The development of blockchains in the oil and gas industry will move toward hybrid blockchain architecture, multi-technology combination, cross-chain, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and more interdisciplinary professionals.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907695","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201708030006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675726","Blockchain;oil and gas industry;smart contract;oil and gas trade;track equipment;supervision","Blockchain;Oils;Natural gas industry;Peer-to-peer computing;Natural gas;Security;Distributed databases","decision making;financial data processing;gas industry;investment;petroleum industry;security of data","blockchain technology;gas industry;gas blockchain projects;oil industry;gas companies;oil companies;decision making;cyber security;hybrid blockchain architecture;multitechnology combination;hybrid consensus mechanism","","85","1","145","OAPA","27 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Industry 4.0, which is expected to have a great impact on manufacturing systems in the future, is attracting attention in both industry and academia. Although academic research on Industry 4.0 is growing exponentially, evidence of Industry 4.0 implementation in practice is still scarce. Moreover, the challenges industry faces when implementing the Industry 4.0 concept seem to be even less addressed. At the start of the present survey, a preliminary literature review identified a lack of comprehensive analysis of the Industry 4.0 implementation challenges. Thus, the purpose of the present article is to provide an overview of the reported Industry 4.0 implementation challenges in the relevant literature by conducting a systematic literature review. Specifically, while the present study differentiates between managerial and technological Industry 4.0 implementation challenges, the focus of the present article is on the managerial Industry 4.0 implementation challenges. This overview is performed by deriving an inductively coded Industry 4.0 technology framework that classifies Industry 4.0 technologies into ten categories: cyber physical systems, Internet of Things, big data analytics, cloud computing, fog and edge computing, augmented and virtual reality, robotics, cyber security, semantic web technologies, and additive manufacturing.

Detecting the components operated during a cyber attack and relating them to a specific threat actor is one of the main challenges facing cyber security systems. Reliable detection of malicious components and identification of the threat actor is imperative to mitigate security issues by Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts. The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a significant role in most cyber attacks observed nowadays in that domains act as a Command and Control (C&C) in coordinated bot network attacks or impersonate legitimate websites in phishing attacks. Thus, DNS analysis has become a popular tool for malicious domain identification. In this collaborative research associating Ben-Gurion University and IBM, we develop a novel algorithm to detect malicious domains and relate them to a specific malware campaign in a large-scale real-data DNS traffic environment, dubbed Identification of Malicious Domain Campaigns (IMDoC) algorithm. Its novelty resides in developing a framework that combines the existence of communicating files for the observed domains and their DNS request patterns in a real production environment. The analysis was conducted on real data from Quad9 (9.9.9.9) DNS recursive resolvers combined with malicious communicating files extracted from VirusTotal, and confirms the strong performance of the algorithm on a real large-scale data production environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3066957","IBM Cyber Security Center of Excellence at Gav-Yam Negev; Israeli National Cyber Bureau via the Cyber Security Research Center at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9381197","Cyber security;domain name system (DNS);clustering methods;detection algorithms","Malware;Servers;IP networks;Security;Production;Prediction algorithms;Reliability","computer crime;computer network security;invasive software;IP networks","malicious communicating files;Quad9 DNS recursive resolvers;observed domains;IMDoC;Malicious Domain Campaigns algorithm;dubbed Identification;real-data DNS traffic environment;specific malware campaign;malicious domains;collaborative research associating Ben-Gurion University;malicious domain identification;DNS analysis;phishing attacks;coordinated bot network attacks;Domain Name System;Security Operations Center analysts;security issues;malicious components;reliable detection;cyber security systems;specific threat actor;cyber attack","","","","55","CCBYNCND","18 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Services and systems powered by the IoT enable smart airports to have enhanced robustness, efficiency and control, governed by real-time monitoring and analytics. Smart sensors control the environmental conditions inside the airport, automate passenger-related actions and support airport security. However, these augmentations and automation introduce security threats to network systems of smart airports. Cyber-attackers demonstrated the susceptibility of IoT systems and networks to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), due to hardware constraints, software flaws or IoT misconfigurations. With the increasing complexity of attacks, it is imperative to safeguard IoT networks of smart airports and ensure reliability of services, as cyber-attacks can have tremendous consequences such as disrupting networks, cancelling travel, or stealing sensitive information. There is a need to adopt and develop new Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled cyber-defence techniques for smart airports, which will address the challenges brought about by the incorporation of IoT systems to the airport business processes, and the constantly evolving nature of contemporary cyber-attacks. In this study, we present a holistic review of existing smart airport applications and services enabled by IoT sensors and systems. Additionally, we investigate several types of cyber defence tools including AI and data mining techniques, and analyse their strengths and weaknesses in the context of smart airports.

Blockchain has been introduced due to its decentralization and security promise, but the election results in the original designs could be biased without collaboration trust, which leads the blockchain-based industry applications invalid. In addition, in existing solutions, neither supernodes nor normal nodes in blockchain can transfer their control authorities for disaster backup. To address the aforementioned challenges, this article proposes a collaborative trust based unbiased control transfer mechanism (CTM), which realizes a dynamic assignment of industrial control. First, a collaborative trust based delegated proof of stake consensus is proposed for determining the authorities of control dynamically and unbiasedly, by designing a lightweight trust propagation protocol.

Security in supply chain is challenging due to the inherent vulnerabilities and threats from any part of the system which can be exploited at any point within the supply chain. This can cause a severe disruption on the overall business continuity. Therefore, it is paramount important to understand and predicate the threats so that organization can undertake necessary control measures for the supply chain security. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) provides an intelligence analysis to discover unknown to known threats using various properties including threat actor skill and motivation, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedure (TT and P), and Indicator of Compromise (IoC). This paper aims to analyse and predicate threats to improve cyber supply chain security. We have applied Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyse and predict the threats based on the CTI properties. That allows to identify the inherent CSC vulnerabilities so that appropriate control actions can be undertaken for the overall cybersecurity improvement. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, CTI data is gathered and a number of ML algorithms, i.e., Logistic Regression (LG), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), are used to develop predictive analytics using the Microsoft Malware Prediction dataset. The experiment considers attack and TTP as input parameters and vulnerabilities and Indicators of compromise (IoC) as output parameters. The results relating to the prediction reveal that Spyware/Ransomware and spear phishing are the most predictable threats in CSC. We have also recommended relevant controls to tackle these threats.

Those who have authorized access to sensitive organizational data are placed in a position of power that could well be abused and could cause significant damage to an organization. This could range from financial theft and intellectual property theft to the destruction of property and business reputation. Traditional intrusion detection systems are neither designed nor capable of identifying those who act maliciously within an organization. In this paper, we describe an automated system that is capable of detecting insider threats within an organization. We define a tree-structure profiling approach that incorporates the details of activities conducted by each user and each job role and then use this to obtain a consistent representation of features that provide a rich description of the user's behavior. Deviation can be assessed based on the amount of variance that each user exhibits across multiple attributes, compared against their peers. We have performed experimentation using ten synthetic data-driven scenarios and found that the system can identify anomalous behavior that may be indicative of a potential threat. We also show how our detection system can be combined with visual analytics tools to support further investigation by an analyst.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2438442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7126970","Anomaly detection;cyber security;insider threat","Organizations;Electronic mail;Computer security;Feature extraction;Intellectual property;Psychology","authorisation;business data processing;data analysis;data visualisation;organisational aspects;tree data structures","automated insider threat detection system;user profile assessment;role-based profile assessment;authorized data access;sensitive organizational data access;financial theft;intellectual property theft;business reputation;intrusion detection systems;tree-structure profiling;user behavior;synthetic data-driven scenarios;visual analytics tools","","70","","26","IEEE","17 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The deployment of emerging technologies allows O&G companies to construct digital twins (DT) of their assets. Considering DT adoption, the O&G industry is still at an early stage with implementations limited to isolated and selective applications instead of industry-wide implementation, limiting the benefits from DT implementation. To gain the full potential of DT and related technological adoption, a comprehensive understanding of DT technology, the current status of O&G-related DT research activities, and the opportunities and challenges associated with the deployment of DT in the O&G industry are of paramount importance. In order to develop this understanding, this paper presents a literature review of DT within the context of the O&G industry. The paper follows a systematic approach to select articles for the literature review. First, a keywords-based publication search was performed on the scientific databases such as Elsevier, IEEE Xplore, OnePetro, Scopus, and Springer. The filtered articles were then analyzed using online text analytic software (Voyant Tools) followed by a manual review of the abstract, introduction and conclusion sections to select the most relevant articles for our study. These articles and the industrial publications cited by them were thoroughly reviewed to present a comprehensive overview of DT technology and to identify current research status, opportunities and challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. From this literature review, it was found that asset integrity monitoring, project planning, and life cycle management are the key application areas of digital twin in the O&G industry while cyber security, lack of standardization, and uncertainty in scope and focus are the key challenges of DT deployment in the O&G industry. When considering the geographical distribution for the DT related research in the O&G industry, the United States (US) is the leading country, followed by Norway, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, China, Italy, Netherland, Brazil, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The overall publication rate was less than ten articles (approximately) per year until 2017, and a significant increase occurred in 2018 and 2019. The number of journal publications was noticeably lower than the number of conference publications, and the majority of the publications presented theoretical concepts rather than the industrial implementations. Both these observations suggest that the DT implementation in the O&G industry is still at an early stage.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998723","Petroleum Research Newfoundland and Labrador (PRNL); Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA); Mitacs; University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy; Memorial University of Newfoundland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104682","Digitalization;digital twin (DT);industry 4.0;extended reality;industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);oil and gas","Industries;Digital twin;Data models;Bibliographies;Oils;Market research;Companies","gas industry;production engineering computing;text analysis","digital twin;oil and gas industry;digital technologies;O&G-related DT research activities;literature review;industrial publications;DT deployment;DT related research;industrial implementations;keyword-based publication search;scientific databases;Elsevier;IEEE Xplore;OnePetro;Scopus;Springer;online text analytic software;Voyant Tools;Norway;United Kingdom;Canada;United States;China;Italy;Netherland;Brazil;Germany;Saudi Arabia","","36","","174","CCBY","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, detecting attacks in large-scale networks is very challenging because they require high detection rates under real-time resource constraints. In this paper, we focus on detecting infected Internet of Things (IoT) hosts from domain name system (DNS) traffic data. IoT hosts, such as streaming cameras, printers, air conditioners, are hard to protect, unlike PCs and servers. Enterprises are often unaware of the devices which are connected to the network, their types, makes, and vulnerabilities. Since IoT hosts make use of the DNS protocol, analyzing DNS data can give a broad view of malicious activities, because they abuse the DNS protocol and leave fingerprints as part of their attack vector. In this collaborative research between Ben-Gurion University, and IBM, we establish a novel algorithm to detect infected IoT hosts in large-scale DNS traffic, named Anomaly and Reputation Based Algorithm (ARBA). Its novelty resides in developing a framework that combines host classification and domain reputation in a real-time production environment. ARBA is highly computational efficient and meets real-time requirements in terms of run time and computational complexity. By contrast to existing algorithms, it does not require a massive traffic volume for training, which is of significant interest in detecting infected hosts in real-time. The research was conducted on real live streaming data from IBM internal network traffic, and confirm the algorithm's strong performance in a real-time production environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014619","IBM Cyber Security Center of Excellence, Gav-Yam Negev; Israeli National Cyber Bureau via the Cyber Security Research Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9160931","Cyber security;anomaly detection;domain name system (DNS);detection algorithms;real-time algorithms","Real-time systems;Machine learning algorithms;Botnet;Computer crime;Internet of Things;Anomaly detection","computer network security;Internet;Internet of Things;invasive software;telecommunication traffic","ARBA;infected IoT devices;cyber attacks;large-scale networks;high detection rates;real-time resource constraints;infected Internet;domain name system traffic data;IoT hosts;DNS protocol;DNS data;attack vector;large-scale DNS traffic;host classification;domain reputation;real-time production environment;real-time requirements;infected hosts;live streaming data;IBM internal network traffic","","3","","58","CCBY","6 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed method aims at solving the detection problem of compromised SDN devices when both the controller and the switch are trustless, and it is complementary with existing detection methods. Our primary idea is to employ backup controllers to audit the handling information of network update events collected from the primary controller and its switches, and to detect compromised devices by recognizing inconsistent or unexpected handling behaviors among the primary controller, backup controllers, and switches. Following this idea, we first capture each network update request and its execution result in the primary controller, collect each received network update instruction and the information of any state update in switches, and deliver these four kinds of information to those backup controllers in an auditor role. An auditor controller is designed to create an audit record for each received network update request and to add its execution result of this network update request as well as the received four kinds of matching information to the audit record. In particular, heterogeneous auditor controllers are proposed to avoid the same vulnerability with the primary controller. The audit algorithm and theoretical proof of its effectiveness for security enhancement are then presented. Finally, based on our prototype implementation, our experimental results further validate the proposed method and its low costs.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2018.2859483","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0800201,2016YFB0800102); Science and Technology Project of State Grid Corporation of China(grant numbers:52110118001F); Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2017C01064,2017C01055,2018C01088,2018C03052); Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China for Testing, Solution Verification and Application Promotion of Industrial Information Physics System; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2016XZZX001-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457529","Software-defined network (SDN);controller hijacking;switch hijacking;SDN forensics;anomaly detection","Switches;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems","auditing;computer network management;computer network security;real-time systems;software defined networking","primary controller;backup controllers;heterogeneous auditor controllers;SDN-RDCD;software-defined network;SDN controller;switch hijacking;real-time method;network update request;security enhancement;detecting compromised devices","","16","","55","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each exchange breach is a threat not only to direct victims, but to the credibility of Bitcoin’s entire ecosystem. Based on an extensive analysis of 36 breaches of Bitcoin exchanges, we show the attack patterns used to exploit Bitcoin exchange platforms using an industry standard for reporting intelligence on cyber security breaches. Based on this we are able to provide an overview of the most common attack vectors, showing that all except three hacks were possible due to relatively lax security. We show that while the security regimen of Bitcoin exchanges is subpar compared to other financial service providers, the use of stolen credentials, which does not require any hacking, is decreasing. We also show that the amount of BTC taken during a breach is decreasing, as well as the exchanges that terminate after being breached. Furthermore we show that overall security posture has improved, but still has major flaws. To discover adversarial methods post-breach, we have analyzed two cases of BTC laundering. Through this analysis we provide insight into how exchange platforms with lax cyber security even further increase the intermediary risk introduced by them into the Bitcoin ecosystem.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.3046145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9300238","Bitcoin;cryptocurrency exchanges;cyber security;cyber threat intelligence;attacks;vulnerabilities;forensics","Bitcoin;Computer crime;Cryptography;Ecosystems;Currencies;Industries;Vocabulary","computer crime;cryptocurrencies;electronic money;financial data processing;security of data","cybersecurity threats;lax cybersecurity;BTC laundering;stolen credentials;financial service providers;Hacking campaigns;Adversary Exploitation;market capitalization;Laundering Techniques;cyber security breaches;Bitcoin exchange platforms;monetary value;Bitcoin ecosystem;adversarial methods post-breach;security posture","","","","83","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, there is a need for a lightweight and efficient security solution to protect the environment. Thus, in this article, we present a robust, lightweight, and provably secure authentication and key agreement protocol specifically for the IoT environment based on a hierarchical approach. The proposed protocol relies on lightweight operations, such as elliptic curve cryptography, physically unclonable functions, hash functions, concatenation, and XOR operations. We then evaluate the security of the designed protocol, including the widely used automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA), and demonstrate that it supports mutual authentication between IoT nodes and server, and is resilient against a number of common security attacks [denial of service (DoS), replay, spoofing, etc.].

Meanwhile, the power system operator may conduct defensive measures to prevent virus-spreading. In this paper, a graphical evolutionary game model is developed to solve the equilibrium of competitions between virus propagations and countermeasures, which helps to evaluate the cyber-security risk of power systems under long-term virus-based intrusions. In the proposed game model, the virus is supposed to propagate itself in a cyber network connecting cyber nodes belonging to power substations. Each cyber node may play as an attacker or a defender according to its state. A death-birth rule is adopted to model probabilistic strategies and state transfers, which reflects the bounded rationality of the viruses. Then, an evolution dynamic equation is derived to obtain the portion of the infected substations when the equilibrium is reached, and simulation algorithm is also given to estimate the infection probability of each substation under the persistent virus-based intrusion.

In this collaborative research between Ben-Gurion University, and IBM, a significant performance improvement was achieved in detecting malicious domains as compared to the state-of-the-art software solutions. Specifically, we establish a novel algorithm to detect malicious domains in large-scale DNS traffic, named Resource-Efficient Malicious Domain Detector (REMaDD), with the following desired properties. First, the algorithm does not require prior knowledge on historical malicious activities in its real-time operations. Second, the development used real live streaming data from The Inter-University Computation Center (IUCC), and operated on real-time IBM system. The algorithm is highly computational efficient and satisfies real-time requirements in terms of running time and computational complexity. REMaDD demonstrated strong performance in terms of both detection accuracy and computational efficiency as compared to existing algorithms. Specifically, experimental results on IBM production environment demonstrated that REMaDD achieved 89.4% Precision score, and 82.9% Recall score.

In this paper, we proposed a novel energy-efficient location privacy preserving (ELPP) scheme in vehicular networks using social intimate fogs (SIFs). ELPP is based on three novel techniques. First, ELPP deal with large bursts of LBS requests by transferring them to their SIF. The key insight is that computing efficiency for location privacy preserving can be gained at the price of some communication delay. Second, ELPP introduces a travel plan-based LBS content pre-caching mechanism, which enables quick and exible retrieval and distribution of the LBS contents.

The CPPS consists of a physical system tightly integrated with cyber systems (control, computing, and communication functions) and allows the two-way flows of electricity and information for enabling smart grid technologies. Even though the digital technologies monitoring and controlling the electric power grid more efficiently and reliably, the power grid is vulnerable to cybersecurity risk and involves the complex interdependency between cyber and physical systems. Analyzing and resolving the problems in CPPS needs the modelling methods and systematic investigation of a complex interaction between cyber and physical systems. The conventional way of modelling, simulation, and analysis involves the separation of physical domain and cyber domain, which is not suitable for the modern CPPS. Therefore, an integrated framework needed to analyze the practical scenario of the unification of physical and cyber systems. A comprehensive review of different modelling, simulation, and analysis methods and different types of cyber-attacks, cybersecurity measures for modern CPPS is explored in this paper.

Complete causal chains connecting component vulnerabilities to cyber attacks causing malicious system-wide effects are unclear, which hinders cyber-attack prevention and the consolidation of affected components. To bridge this research gap, this survey aims to study two issues that need further investigation. On one hand, the causal relationship between power grid component vulnerabilities and resulting cyber attacks has not been thoroughly explored. On the other hand, the evolvement of cyber attacks, from initial attempt to resulting serious consequences has not been resolved. To study these two issues, we first analyze various stakeholders and associated information flows in diverse applications in power grid operation. Second, we summarize the root cause of cyber attacks in the vulnerability of communication protocols. Third, a multi-stage model is proposed to describe the cyber vulnerabilities, which reveals potential attacks and their evolvement on power grid components at each stage, assesses the associated impact on the entire power grid, and elucidates possible countermeasures.

To address this issue, we propose a new one-shot model called “Multi-Loss Siamese Neural Network with Batch Normalization Layer” that can work with fewer samples while providing high detection accuracy. Our model utilizes the Siamese Neural Network to detect new variants of malware that is trained with only a few samples. Our model is equipped with batch normalization and multiple loss functions to address the overfitting issue, due to the use of small samples, that can create the vanishing gradient problem as a result of binary cross-entropy loss, and feature embedding space to improve the detection accuracy.

The proposed EP-based sampling decoding scheme not only theoretically addresses the inherent convergence problem of EP, but also is able to achieve the near-optimal decoding performance with the increment of Markov moves. Specifically, the EP-based independent Metropolis-Hastings (MH) is proposed to guarantee the exponential convergence to the target posterior distribution, thus bridging the EP detector and the sampling decoding as a whole. Meanwhile, the output yielded by the EP detector also provides a good initial setup for the sampling decoding, which results in a better convergence performance in the approximation.

In that regard, we propose to quantify dependability and security measures of an Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT) infrastructure relied on an integrated physical architecture of cloud/fog/edge (CFE) computing paradigms in this article. We propose a reliability/availability quantification methodology for the IoMT infrastructure using a hierarchical model of three levels: 1) fault tree (FT) of overall IoMT infrastructure consisting of CFE member systems; 2) FT of subsystems within CFE member systems; and 3) continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models of components/devices in the subsystems. We incorporate a number of failure modes for the underlying subsystems, including Mandel-bug related failures and non-Mandel bugs related failure, as well as failures due to cyber-security attacks on software subsystems. Five case-studies of configuration alternation and four operational scenarios of the IoMT infrastructure are considered to comprehend the dependability characteristics of the IoMT physical infrastructure. The metrics of interest include reliability over time, steady state availability (SSA), sensitivity of SSA wrt. selected mean time to failure—equivalent (MTTFeq) and mean time to recovery—equivalent (MTTReq), and sensitivity of SSA wrt. frequencies of cyber-security attacks on software subsystems. The analysis results help comprehend operational behaviors and properties of a typical IoMT infrastructure. The findings of this study can improve the design and implementation of real-world IoMT infrastructures consisting of cloud, fog, and edge computing paradigms.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3081420","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2020R1A6A1A03046811); NRF(grant numbers:NRF-2018R1D1A1B070467791); Korea government (MSIT); Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) grant; Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport(grant numbers:20CTAP-C152021-02); Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program; Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2020-2016-0-00465); “The Competency Development Program for Industry Specialist” of the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE); Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT)(grant numbers:N0002428); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9434376","Availability;cloud computing;cyber security attack;edge computing;e-health monitoring;fog computing;hierarchical model;Internet of Medical Things (IoMT);reliability","Security;Medical services;Reliability;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Cloud computing;Data models","cloud computing;fault trees;health care;Internet of Things;Markov processes;program debugging;security of data","cloud-fog-edge continuum;healthcare monitoring;hierarchical model;autonomous operations;healthcare systems;security measures;Internet-of-Medical Things infrastructure;integrated physical architecture;CFE member systems;continuous-time Markov chain models;failure modes;Mandel-bug related failures;nonMandel bugs related failure;cyber-security attacks;software subsystems;IoMT physical infrastructure;SSA wrt;IoMT infrastructure;edge computing paradigms;security quantification;fault tree;steady state availability;mean time to recovery-equivalent","","6","","84","IEEE","18 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several research works have been conducted to secure medical healthcare images. Encryption, not risking loss of data, is the right solution for image confidentiality. Due to data size limitations, redundancy, and capacity, traditional encryption techniques cannot be applied directly to e-health data, especially when patient data are transferred over the open channels. Therefore, patients may lose the privacy of data contents since images are different from the text because of their two particular factors of loss of data and confidentiality. Researchers have identified such security threats and have proposed several image encryption techniques to mitigate the security problem. However, the study has found that the existing proposed techniques still face application-specific several security problems. Therefore, this paper presents an efficient, lightweight encryption algorithm to develop a secure image encryption technique for the healthcare industry. The proposed lightweight encryption technique employs two permutation techniques to secure medical images. The proposed technique is analyzed, evaluated, and then compared to conventionally encrypted ones in security and execution time. Numerous test images have been used to determine the performance of the proposed algorithm. Several experiments show that the proposed algorithm for image cryptosystems provides better efficiency than conventional techniques.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3061710","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) under Fundamental Research Grant Scheme(grant numbers:FRGS/1/2020/ICT03/UKM/02/6); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9361564","Internet of Medical Things;medical image encryption;lightweight encryption","Security;Encryption;Medical services;Privacy;Protocols;Organizations;Authentication","computer network security;cryptography;health care;image enhancement;Internet of Things;medical image processing","image cryptosystems;medical image security enhancement;Internet of Medical Things applications;image confidentiality;data size limitations;e-health data;lightweight encryption algorithm;secure image encryption technique;permutation techniques;medical healthcare image encryption techniques","","12","","56","CCBY","24 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the proposed model, when an emergency event (e.g., an obstacle in front of the road) occurs, the emergency messages can be disseminated among the nearby vehicles in a trust cascading manner, where the entity-oriented trust values (which are evaluated and updated by leveraging the trust certificates and are contained in the messages) are adopted as important weights. Subsequently, the theoretical analysis for the robustness against several kinds of attacks and malicious behaviors, failure tolerance features, compatibility for several kinds of special situations, and incentive mechanisms in the TCEMD model are detailed.

Therefore, organizations rely on Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) to support them in better understanding the threats and associated impacts of cyber events. Due to the heterogeneity and complexity of cyber security data, often with multidimensional attributes, sophisticated visualization techniques are needed to achieve CSA. However, there have been no previous attempts to systematically review and analyze the scientific literature on CSA visualizations. In this paper, we systematically select and review 54 publications that discuss visualizations to support CSA. We extract data from these papers to identify key stakeholders, information types, data sources, and visualization techniques. Furthermore, we analyze the level of CSA supported by the visualizations, alongside examining the maturity of the visualizations, challenges, and practices related to CSA visualizations to prepare a full analysis of the current state of CSA in an organizational context. Our results reveal certain gaps in CSA visualizations. For instance, the largest focus is on operational-level staff, and there is a clear lack of visualizations targeting other types of stakeholders such as managers, higher-level decision makers, and non-expert users. Most papers focus on threat information visualization, and there is a dearth of papers that visualize impact information, response plans, and information shared within teams. Interestingly, we find that only a few studies proposed visualizations to facilitate up to the <italic>projection</italic> level (i.e., the highest level of CSA), whereas most studies facilitated only the <italic>perception</italic> level (i.e., the lowest level of CSA). Most of the studies provide evidence of the proposed visualizations through toy examples and demonstrations, while only a few visualizations are employed in industrial practice.

In this paper, an attacker is considered a participant in the virtual bidding procedure in the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) electricity markets to maximize its profit. The cyber attacker attempts to identify the optimal power system measurements to attack along with the false data injected into measurement devices. Towards the maximum profit, the attacker needs to specify the relation between manipulated meters, virtual power traded in the markets, and electricity prices. Meanwhile, to avoid being detected by the system operator, the attacker considers the physical power system constraints existing in the DA and RT markets.

At the same time, consumers are now more interested in food product quality. However, it is challenging to track the provenance of data and maintain its traceability throughout the supply chain network. The traditional supply chains are centralized and they depend on a third party for trading. These centralized systems lack transparency, accountability and auditability. In our proposed solution, we have presented a complete solution for blockchain-based Agriculture and Food (Agri-Food) supply chain. It leverages the key features of blockchain and smart contracts, deployed over ethereum blockchain network. Although blockchain provides immutability of data and records in the network, it still fails to solve some major problems in supply chain management like credibility of the involved entities, accountability of the trading process and traceability of the products. Therefore, there is a need of a reliable system that ensures traceability, trust and delivery mechanism in Agri-Food supply chain. In the proposed system, all transactions are written to blockchain which ultimately uploads the data to Interplanetary File Storage System (IPFS). The storage system returns a hash of the data which is stored on blockchain and ensures efficient, secure and reliable solution. Our system provides smart contracts along with their algorithms to show interaction of entities in the system.

Considering that customers’ preferences for hotel prices are actually acceptable ranges and traditional point estimations may neglect some informative aspects of the prediction, interval estimation is more suitable for the problem investigated in this paper. However, existing related methods are not applicable due to some specific issues. To provide a better personalized recommendation of hotels in OTA platforms, this paper proposes a novel interval forecasting solution to improve the accuracy of predicting users’ price preferences. The novel interval forecasting solution first puts forward a customized objective function which could directly measure the quality of constructed intervals, while also allowing for adjustable tradeoffs between interval tightness and prediction reliability.

It is very useful for tourists to plan their travel routes when they want to travel at unfamiliar scenic cities. Existing methods for travel route planning mainly concentrate on a single planning problem for a special task, but is not capable of being applied to other tasks. For example, previous must-visit planning methods cannot be applied to the next-point recommendation, despite these two tasks are closely related to each other in travel route planning. Besides, most of the existing work do not consider the important auxiliary information such as Point of Interests (POI) attributes, user preference, and historical route data in their approaches. In this paper, we propose a flexible Multi-task Deep Travel Route Planning framework named MDTRP to integrate rich auxiliary information for more effective planning. Specifically, we first construct a heterogeneous network through the relations between users and POIs and employ a heterogeneous network embedding method to learn the features of users and POIs. Then we present an attention-based deep model to integrate the auxiliary information and focus on important visited points for the prediction of next POIs. Finally, a beam search algorithm is introduced to flexibly generate multiple feasible route candidates for three types of planning tasks (next-point recommendation, general route planning, and must-visit planning). We introduce six public datasets to conduct extensive experiments, of which the results demonstrate the flexibility and superiority of the proposed approach in travel route planning.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.2987645","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1736203,61825203,61906075,61932010,61732021); Major Program of Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research(grant numbers:2019B030302008); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1402600,SQ2017YFGX110188-03,2017YFB0802203); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017B010111005,2019A1515011920); Guangzhou Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:201802010061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115053","Travel route planning;deep learning;heterogeneous network embedding;attention model","Planning;Task analysis;Data models;Heterogeneous networks;Traveling salesman problems;Hidden Markov models;Correlation","learning (artificial intelligence);path planning;planning;recommender systems;search problems;travel industry","general route planning;Multitask Travel Route Planning;travel routes;single planning problem;planning methods;flexible Multitask Deep Travel Route Planning framework;planning tasks","","2","","60","IEEE","11 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The double authentication preventing ring signature (DAPRS) is a cryptographic primitive that meets requirements of authenticity, anonymity of users’ private data, and linkability of users’ misbehavior, so it is suitable for monitoring behaviors of risky users. In this article, we propose a post-quantum secure ring signature to enhance security and privacy in Cybertwin-driven 6G (PRSG). In the PRSG, we first put forward an accumulator based on a chameleon hash function that allows to efficiently prove knowledge of an accumulated value.

This is particularly crucial for the IIoT environment, such as those in critical infrastructure sectors, such as energy and dams. Therefore, in this article, we propose an optimal resource allocation scheme for a fog-based IIoT environment. Specifically, we introduce fog nodes (or FSPs) that compete with each other to provide services for the DUs using resources from the CC. To maximize resource utilization, we model the resource allocation problem as a double-stage Stackelberg game and propose three algorithms to achieve Nash equilibrium and Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, we evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme with and without having FSPs, as well as with another competing scheme.

The idea of our key access control scheme, which is based on Shamir's secret sharing algorithm and polynomial interpolation method, is suitable especially for hierarchical organizational structures. It offers a secure, flexible, and hierarchical key access mechanism for organizations utilizing mission-critical data. It also minimizes concerns about moving mission-critical data to the public cloud and ensures that only users with sufficient approvals from the same or higher privileged users can access the key by making use of the topological ordering of a directed graph, including self-loop. Main overheads such as public and private storage needs are reduced to a tolerable level, and the key derivation is computationally efficient. From a security perspective, our scheme is both resistant to collaboration attacks and provides key indistinguishability security.

The attention mechanism plays a crucial role in relating the question to meaningful image regions for answer inference. However, most existing VQA methods: 1) learn the attention distribution either from free-form regions or detection boxes in the image, which is intractable in answering questions about the foreground object and background form, respectively and 2) neglect the prior knowledge of human attention and learn the attention distribution with an unguided strategy. To fully exploit the advantages of attention, the learned attention distribution should focus more on the question-related image regions, such as human attention for both the questions, about the foreground object and background form. To achieve this, this article proposes a novel VQA model, called adversarial learning of supervised attentions (ALSAs). Specifically, two supervised attention modules: 1) free form-based and 2) detection-based, are designed to exploit the prior knowledge for attention distribution learning. To effectively learn the correlations between the question and image from different views, that is, free-form regions and detection boxes, an adversarial learning mechanism is implemented as an interplay between two supervised attention modules. The adversarial learning reinforces the two attention modules mutually to make the learned multiview features more effective for answer inference.

Although these methods exploit interactive information between different modalities to improve comprehension ability, inter- and intra-modality correlations cannot be effectively integrated in a uniform model. To address this problem, we propose a novel VideoQA model called Cross-Attentional Spatio-Temporal Semantic Graph Networks (CASSG). Specifically, a multi-head multi-hop attention module with diversity and progressivity is first proposed to explore fine-grained interactions between different modalities in a crossing manner. Then, heterogeneous graphs are constructed from the cross-attended video frames, clips, and question words, in which the multi-stream spatio-temporal semantic graphs are designed to synchronously reasoning inter- and intra-modality correlations. Last, the global and local information fusion method is proposed to coalesce the local reasoning vector learned from multi-stream spatio-temporal semantic graphs and the global vector learned from another branch to infer the answer.

The electronic components construct an in-vehicle network that internally shares relevant status information about the vehicle. As modern vehicles become more computerized, the potential for automotive cyber-security threats also increases a fact that has been illustrated clearly by various car-hacking demonstrations. Using the controller area network (CAN), the de facto standard protocol in the automotive industry that facilitates in-vehicle network communication, car-hacking demonstrations inject critical CAN messages to control vehicular functions. In efforts to address this security issue, car manufacturers, in turn, have made confidential the CAN database (i.e., DBC format file), where signal information assigned in the CAN data payload is specified. However, it has since become known that this policy does not hermetically seal a vehicular network against cyber attacks. On the contrary, in-depth automotive security research has been hindered significantly because of the limited information accessible by researchers. For example, automotive intrusion detection systems (IDS) identify and alert when there is a vehicular break-in, and this technology is a major area of study in automotive cyber security research. For the automotive IDS that analyzes CAN traffic, information in the DBC format file greatly improves detection veracity. However, most IDS technologies to date have been independently developed without the confidential CAN DB information and, as a result, do not mitigate threats to a satisfactory standard. In this paper, we propose an enhanced method that identifies signal boundaries in a CAN data payload, which is specified in the DBC format file. Unlike an existing method that is designed based on total bit-flip rates, our method analyzes bit-flip time series not total bit-flip rates so that signal boundaries can be more clearly identified. In this paper, we use a publicly available DBC format file called OpenDBC as a reference, and show that our method outperforms the existing method.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3063261","Samsung Research Funding, and Incubation Center for Future Technology(grant numbers:SRFC-TB1403-51); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2020R1C1C1007446); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9369078","Automotive security;CAN DBC format file;controller area network (CAN);reverse engineering","Automotive engineering;Security;Payloads;Standards;Intrusion detection;Automobiles;Software","automotive electronics;computer network security;controller area networks;electronic engineering computing","in-vehicle network communication;car-hacking demonstrations;CAN messages;vehicular functions;security issue;car manufacturers;signal information;vehicular network;in-depth automotive security research;automotive intrusion detection systems;automotive cyber security research;automotive IDS;IDS technologies;confidential CAN DB information;signal boundaries;total bit-flip rates;publicly available DBC format file;reverse engineering;automotive cyber-security threats;controller area network;automotive industry;CAN data payload;CAN database","","4","","30","IEEE","3 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data breaches, ransomware attacks, crypto-jacking, malware and phishing attacks are now rampant. In this era of cyber warfare, the software industry is also growing with an increasing number of software being used in all domains of life. This evolution has added to the problems of software vendors and users where they have to prevent a wide range of attacks. Existing watermark detection solutions have a low detection rate in the software. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a novel blind Zero code based Watermark detection approach named KeySplitWatermark, for the protection of software against cyber-attacks. The algorithm adds watermark logically into the code utilizing the inherent properties of code and gives a robust solution. The embedding algorithm uses keywords to make segments of the code to produce a key-dependent on the watermark. The extraction algorithms use this key to remove watermark and detect tampering. When tampering increases to a certain user-defined threshold, the original software code is restored making it resilient against attacks. KeySplitWatermark is evaluated on tampering attacks on three unique samples with two distinct watermarks. The outcomes show that the proposed approach reports promising results against cyber-attacks that are powerful and viable. We compared the performance of our proposal with state-of-the-art works using two different software codes. Our results depict that KeySplitWatermark correctly detects watermarks, resulting in up to 15.95 and 17.43 percent reduction in execution time on given code samples with no increase in program size and independent of watermark size.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988160","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant; Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2018R1C1B5045013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9068217","Cyber-attacks;watermarking;software;algorithm;blind detection;attack models;security","Watermarking;Software algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Malware;Software protection","computer crime;cryptography;invasive software;security of data;watermarking","crypto-jacking;extraction algorithms;data breaches;blind zero code;watermark size;tampering attacks;software code;watermark detection solutions;software vendors;software industry;cyber warfare;phishing attacks;malware;ransomware attacks;cyber-attacks;software protection;Zero watermarking algorithm;KeySplitWatermark","","53","","43","CCBY","15 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These digital systems are prone to vulnerabilities/attacks, and exploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause major impacts on the electric grid performance. Multiple alarms reported in the control center could be a result of the faults (expected operations) or failures in the protection system (anomalies/ unexpected operation). Situational awareness gained through sensors such as a phasor measurement unit (PMU) and data acquired through the cyber system provide an opportunity to develop continuous cyber-physical monitoring of the system. Note that relay data are not reported in the control center continuously. This paper presents a cyber-physical data analytics based technique to monitor transmission protection system and detect malicious activity. Initially, continuous monitoring of PMU data is utilized for data anomaly detection, which includes bad or missing data using long short-term memory (LSTM). Then, PMU data of interest are utilized for failure diagnosis, using a semisupervised deep autoencoder model. In this research, cyber anomalies are modeled by manipulating the setting/logic design of protective devices, and a ridge regression based classifier with a feature engineering pipeline is used to detect cyber anomalies. The results from the deep autoencoder model and ridge regression based classifier are then utilized for detailed investigation to find the root causes of the observed events assisted by the cyber log data from the protection devices. The algorithm is validated using a real-time simulation of the IEEE test system with industrial hardware relays and PMUs in the loop. Data analytics algorithm running on server utilizes these real-time data continuously for anomaly detection and classification for the developed use cases.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2019.2928500","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1840192); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8762160","Cyber anomalies;cyber-physical systems;cyber security;data analytics;digital protection;transmission protection systems","Phasor measurement units;Logic gates;Circuit faults;Relays;Data analysis;Anomaly detection;Power grids","computerised monitoring;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;regression analysis;security of data;smart power grids","bad data;missing data;PMU data;semisupervised deep autoencoder model;cyber anomalies;protective devices;cyber log data;protection devices;IEEE test system;data analytics algorithm;real-time data;classification;cyber physical security analytics;transmission protection system;transmission system;digital systems;control center;cyber system;continuous cyber-physical monitoring;relay data;cyber-physical data analytics;continuous monitoring;data anomaly detection","","22","","32","IEEE","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, synthesized false data injection attacks could wisely circumvent conventional bad data detection mechanisms by introducing arbitrary errors to state estimates to seriously affect the entire power system operation. To defend these attacks, phase measurement units (PMUs) are deployed in advance at various locations to reduce the chance of being attacked. However, when the budget of placement is not large enough so that the whole system cannot be covered by PMUs, the existing PMU placement algorithms based on greedy strategies are insufficient in some weak locations due to the nature of greedy strategies. In this article, we propose a new hybrid attack, which can be easily used by attackers to attack the buses with less connectivity and impose adverse impacts to state estimation with a low-attack cost so that existing defenses based on greedy strategies become invalid. We future propose a predeployment PMU greedy algorithm for this new attack in which the most vulnerable buses are first protected and, then, a greedy-based algorithm is used to deploy other PMUs until the whole system is observable.

Microgrid protection requires a fast, reliable, and robust communication system to adjust relay settings to the appropriate current level according to the operation mode. Various approaches have been implemented to deal with this problem, yet the most promising ones are the use of adaptive protection techniques abiding by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61850 communication standard. This paper presents a review of the technical challenges for the use of classical protection techniques and the need for an enhanced, adaptive, smart protection system. However, the risk of communication link failures and cyber security threats still remain a challenge in implementing a reliable adaptive protection scheme. A contingency is essential in the event that a communication failure prevents a relay from adjusting between grid-connected and islanded mode. An adaptive protection scheme is proposed, which utilizes energy storage devices to enhance resiliency against communication outages. The proposed solution does not incur additional costs to the network, as the energy storage devices are already utilized for other purposes. A case study experimentally verifies this contingency under a worst-case scenario, where a fault occurs simultaneously with a pulsed load while operating in islanded mode with a communication failure.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2017.2776858","U.S. Department of Energy; Office of Naval Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8118098","Cyber-attacks;energy storage;hybrid energy storage systems (HESS);microgrids;protection scheme","Microgrids;Relays;Circuit faults;Fault currents;Energy storage;IEC Standards;Reliability","distributed power generation;energy storage;IEC standards;power generation faults;power generation protection;power generation reliability;security of data;smart power grids","islanded mode;energy storage devices;communication outages;communication failure impacts;adaptive microgrid protection schemes;adequate protection scheme;fast communication system;robust communication system;relay settings;operation mode;adaptive protection techniques;classical protection techniques;enhanced protection system;adaptive protection system;smart protection system;communication link failures;cyber security threats;adaptive protection scheme;international electrotechnical commission 61850 communication standard","","77","","121","IEEE","22 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With its extensive usage in diverse scenarios, IoT devices generate bulk data contrived by attackers to disrupt normal operations and services. Hence, there is a need for proactive data analysis to prevent cyber-attacks and crimes. To investigate crimes involving Electronic Mail (e-mail), analysis of both the header and the email body is required since the semantics of communication helps to identify the source of potential evidence. With the continued growth of data shared via emails, investigators now face the daunting challenge of extracting the required semantic information from the bulks of emails, thereby causing a delay in the investigation process. This gives an edge to the criminal in erasing their footprints of malicious acts. The existing keyword-based search techniques and filtration often result in extraneous, short sequence emails, which skips meaningful information. To overcome the above limitation, we propose a novel efficient approach named SeFACED that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) for multiclass email classification. SeFACED not only works on short sequences but with long dependencies of 1000+ characters as well. SeFACED focuses on tuning LSTM based GRU parameters to attain the best performance and with assessment by comparing it with traditional machine learning, deep learning models, and state-of-the-art studies on the subject.

Apart from traditional networks, IDSs have been implemented in various emerging networks, such as mobile networks and Vehicle Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). However, a critical problem in IDSs is that the detection capacity is gradually decaying with the emergence of unknown attacks. It is necessary to constantly retrain IDSs with a more extensive database, but the security institutes usually lack the motivation to persistently update and maintain the database for public. Thus, in this paper, a lifetime learning framework is proposed for IDSs with a blockchain-based database (bc-DB). In the proposed framework, the blockchain-based database is multilaterally maintained by the security institutes and universities using Data Coins (DCoins) as the incentives. In addition, a Lifetime Learning IDS (LL-IDS) is further designed as the supplement of the bc-DB for common IDS users. For the LL-IDS, the Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map with probabilistic relabeling (GHSOM-pr) having flexible and hierarchical architecture is employed as the classifier, which grows to make itself perfectly fit the changeable bc-DB. Security analysis and simulation experiments show that the proposed lifetime learning framework are both secure and effective in attacks detection.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3064607","A*STAR under its RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) Industry Alignment Fund C PrePositing (IAF-PP)(grant numbers:A19D6a0053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9372930","IDSs;Cyber Security;bc-DB;DCoins;LL-IDS;and GHSOM-pr","Blockchain;Security;Databases;Peer-to-peer computing;Intrusion detection;Data mining;Distributed databases","blockchains;computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;vehicular ad hoc networks","Vehicle Ad hoc Networks;detection capacity;lifetime learning framework;blockchain-based database;bc-DB;LL-IDS;common IDS users;attacks detection;Intrusion Detection System;cyber security;mobile networks;Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map with probabilistic relabeling;GHSOM-pr;data coins;DCoins","","3","","46","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, this article attempts to study the interpretations of machine learning algorithms to make them more applicable to the 6G-enabled Internet of things (IoT) networks. Typically, this article focuses on the new model GBDT2NN, which distills the knowledge learned by gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) into neural network (NN) models to retain the learning ability of numerical data and rise the ability of online learning at the same time, but it loses the interpretability. This article conducts an empirical study on explaining individual prediction of GBDT2NN by taking use of the feature importance learned from GBDT, and then further explores whether the explanation can improve the approximation process. In addition, this article proposes two methods to obtain the interpretations: 1) the independent method and 2) the joint method.

In the main, organisations employ reactive approaches for cyber security, focused on rectifying immediate incidents and preventing repeat attacks, through protections such as vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT) security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls, anti-spam/anti-malware solutions and system patches. Such system have weaknesses in addressing modern modern stealthy attacks. Proactive approaches, have been seen as part of the solution to this problem. However, approaches such as VAPT have limited scope and only works with threats that have already been discovered. Promising methods such as threat hunting are gaining momentum, enabling organisations to identify and rapidly respond to any potential attacks, though they have been criticised for their significant cost. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid model for uncovering tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) through offensive security, specifically threat hunting via adversary emulation. The proposed technique is based on a novel approach of inducing adversary emulation (mapping each respective phase) model inside the threat hunting approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach uses threat hunting via adversary emulation and has countervailing effects on hunting advance level threats. Moreover, the threat detection ability of the proposed approach utilizes minimum resources. The proposed approach can be used to develop the offensive security-aware environment for organizations to uncover advanced attack mechanisms and test their ability for attack detection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104260","Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research - University of Warwick(grant numbers:EP/R007195/1); The Alan Turing Institute(grant numbers:EP/N510129/1); PETRAS National Centre of Excellence for IoT Systems Cybersecurity(grant numbers:EP/S035362/1); Higher Education Commission, Pakistan, Technology Development Initiative from Cyber Security Lab COMSATS University Islamabad(grant numbers:TDF-206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9511495","Offensive security;threat hunting;proactive defense;red teaming;adversary emulation;mitre ATT&CK;threat analysis","Security;Emulation;Organizations;Penetration testing;Weapons;Tools;Testing","computer network security;firewalls;invasive software;unsolicited e-mail","critical data;advanced stealthy methods;legitimate tools;cyber security;vulnerability assessment and penetration testing;VAPT;stealthy attacks;proactive approach;potential attacks;threat hunting;advance level threats;threat detection;offensive security-aware environment;advanced attack mechanisms;attack detection;adversary emulation model;repeat attack prevention;proactive threat hunting;firewalls;antispam solution;antimalware solution;security information and event management","","6","","40","CCBY","11 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the interconnectivity between sensors and controllers creates potential vulnerabilities which can be exploited by a cyber-attack. The majority of components installed on the grid were designed with little or no consideration for aspects of cyber-security and therefore leaving the network at risk of economic loss, asset damage or widespread blackouts. Present research in cyber-attack events and electrical grid resilience, often treats these in isolation. Furthermore, the ICT infrastructure in modern electrical networks is not tested as rigorously in terms of reliability and security as the physical assets. Therefore, an integrated approach is needed for the analysis of cyber-threats against power systems, linking the attack mechanisms in the ICT layer and the physical impacts at the electrical layer. This paper introduces a method of self-organizing communication architectures that for the first time has been applied to the problem of mitigating the negative impacts of denial of service cyber-attacks in the smart grid and demonstrates the benefits of this in a novel integrated environment connecting power system modeling and communication layer simulation.

Recently PLCs are often utilized in a modernized power grid system for implementing an additional layer of automated control, such as operation of circuit breakers under specific conditions. Thus, in order to create a software-based smart grid testbed (or ‘cyber range’ for cyber security experiments); emulation of the PLC is imperative. OpenPLC is a software widely used for emulating PLCs, but unfortunately it does not support IEC 61850 standard, which is the globally adopted standard for substation automation in smart power grid systems. Thus, in this paper, the enhancement of OpenPLC to support IEC 61850 protocol and information models is discussed. The performance of the implementation has been validated to corroborate its application for use cases in the smart grid paradigm. Subsequently, the implementation is demonstrated in a smart grid cyber range to evaluate the impacts of attacks and thereby, the effectiveness of security measures and robustness of PLC control logic.

There exists a critical gap between the time needed (demand) and the time available (limited analyst resource) for alert investigation at a CSOC. Hence, alert prioritization is important, for which CSOCs employ ad-hoc filtering methods to prune and triage the alerts that are presented to the analysts for investigation. One of the major drawbacks of the ad-hoc methods is that they do not comprehensively take into consideration the organization-specific factors such as mission and asset criticality, CSOC resource availability, demand variations, and the desired CSOC performance metrics. Hence, an ad-hoc triaging (or prioritization) method is insufficient, and an intelligent method for optimal selection of alerts that considers the above-mentioned organization-specific factors must be developed, which is described as a two-step process in this paper. First, a composite risk score of each alert is determined using a quantitative value function hierarchy process, which takes into account several organization-specific factors. Second, an optimization model selects a list of alerts for investigation that optimizes the CSOC performance metrics for a given demand subject to its resource constraints. Experimental results show that the alerts that pertain to mission criticalities are handled in a timelier manner as compared to current practices at the CSOCs. The average persistence time of an alert in the CSOC system is also shown to significantly reduce with this new approach, which is a paradigm shift in providing a stronger cyber-defense system by protecting the critical constituents of an organization.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2018.2886465","Army Research Office(grant numbers:Grants W911NF-13-1-0421,W911NF-15-1-0576); Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8573836","Alert prioritization;CSOC;optimization;quantitative value function hierarchy model;risk-score","Organizations;Optimization;Computational modeling;Mission critical systems;Analytical models;Measurement;Adaptation models","optimisation;risk analysis;security of data","organization-specific factors;CSOC performance metrics;Cyber Security Operations Center;cyber-defense system;optimization model;quantitative value function hierarchy process;CSOC system;optimal selection;ad-hoc triaging;CSOC resource availability;ad-hoc filtering methods;alert prioritization;alert investigation","","1","","45","IEEE","12 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rapidly spreading breast cancer is due to the abnormal growth of malignant cells in the breast. Early detection of breast cancer can increase treatment opportunities and patient survival rates. Various screening methods with computer-aided detection systems have been developed for the effective diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Image data plays an important role in the medical and health industry. Features are extracted from image datasets through deep learning, as deep learning techniques extract features more accurately and rapidly than other existing methods. Deep learning effectively assists existing methods, such as mammogram screening and biopsy, in examining and diagnosing breast cancer.

Fully integrated DMFBs consist of a hardware platform, controller, and network connectivity, making it a cyber-physical system (CPS). A DMFB CPS is being advocated for safety-critical applications, such as medical diagnosis, drug development, and personalized medicine. Hence, the security of a DMFB CPS is of immense importance to their successful deployment. Recent research has made progress in devising corresponding defense mechanisms by employing so-called checkpoints (CPs). Existing solutions either rely on probabilistic security analysis that does not consider all possible actions an attacker may use to overcome an applied CP mechanism or rely on exhaustive monitoring of DMFB at all time-steps during the assay execution. For devising a defense scheme that is guaranteed to be secure, an exact analysis of the security of a DMFB is needed. This is not available in the current state-of-the-art. In this article, we address this issue by developing an exact method, which uses the deductive power of satisfiability solvers to verify whether a CP-based defense thwarts the execution of an attack. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method by showcasing two applications on practical bioassays: 1) security analysis of various checkpointing strategies and 2) derivation of a counterexample-guided fool-proof secure CP scheme.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2020.2988351","Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF-17-1-0320); NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1833622,CNS-1833624); New York University Center for Cyber Security (CCS); New York University Abu Dhabi Center for Cyber Security (CCS-AD); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9069286","Computer security;control systems;fluid flow control;fluidics;industry applications;microfluidics;security","Electrodes;Monitoring;Drugs;Software;Computer security","bioMEMS;checkpointing;lab-on-a-chip;microfluidics;power system security","defenses;counterexample-guided fool-proof secure CP scheme;checkpointing strategies;CP-based defense thwarts;exact analysis;defense scheme;applied CP mechanism;probabilistic security analysis;checkpoints;corresponding defense mechanisms;immense importance;drug development;medical diagnosis;safety-critical applications;DMFB CPS;cyber-physical system;network connectivity;hardware platform;biochemical protocols;miniaturized laboratory;digital microfluidic biochip","","2","","74","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have reviewed the state-of-the-art in the PEC paradigm and its applications to the IIoT domain, which have been enabled by the recent developments in 5G technology.

The proposed model considers both integrity attack and availability attack simultaneously. Compared with the particular attack, namely, false data injected attack, we analyze their consequences to power systems in the events of false negatives attack and false alarm attack. The results show that the hybrid attack can confuse the control center by manipulating the integrity and availability of measurements. More importantly, we evaluate the hybrid attack with different values of the cost ratio between integrity and availability attacks, and then verify that the hybrid attack can achieve the same goal with a reduced cost.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3003323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9120058","Cyber-physical power system;cyber security;attack cost;differential evolution algorithm","Cyberattack;Power systems;Transmission line measurements;Mathematical model;State estimation;Meters;SCADA systems","power engineering computing;power grids;power system security;power system simulation;power system state estimation;security of data","hybrid cyber attack model;cyber-physical power systems;cyber security;cyber physical attacks;hybrid attack model;power grids;integrity attack;false negatives attack;false alarm attack;false data injected attack","","7","","32","CCBY","18 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Especially, for cyber security being able to identify rare types of network activities or anomalies from network traffic data (a.k.a. Big Data!) is an important but time-consuming data analysis task having moderate computing resources. Existing research has shown that it is possible to detect rare anomalies from the summarized version of big data. Therefore, summarization is an effective preprocessing function before applying anomaly detection techniques. This aim of this paper is to improve and quantify the scalability and accuracy of the anomaly detection techniques by using summarization. Hence, we propose a sampling-based summarization technique (SUCh: Summarization Using Chernoff-Bound) which is computationally effective than the existing techniques and also performs better in identifying rare anomalies from twelve benchmark network traffic datasets. The experimental results show that, instead of using original dataset, a summary of the data yields better performance in terms of true positive and false positive rates, when used for anomaly detection with less time required.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2918364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8720160","Anomaly detection;data summarization;sampling;clustering;SCADA;network traffic","Anomaly detection;Tools;Big Data;Protocols;IP networks;Computer security;Task analysis","Big Data;data analysis;sampling methods;security of data","cyber security;network activities;network traffic data;anomaly detection techniques;sampling-based summarization technique;preprocessing function;patterns identification;intelligent Big Data summarization;data analysis task;summarization using Chernoff-bound;SUCh","","11","","16","OAPA","22 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, since the readings are done via the Internet, there is the tendency for the data to be compromised when it gets into the hands of the wrong people. Moreover, customers mostly do not know why they pay huge amounts and which appliances use more electricity, since they are not privy to the readings. The sovereign blockchain technology, which provides transparency and provenance, is utilized in this paper to mitigate these above mentioned problems. A smart contract, which executes laid down procedures to provide a trust-based system between participants on the network is also implemented.

Firstly, the scheme can satisfy various security properties such as decentralization, openness, and tamper resistance. A reliable mechanism is created for the doctors to store medical data or access the historical data of patients while meeting privacy preservation. Furthermore, a symptoms-matching mechanism is given between patients.

Sensor nodes are treated as smart devices and widely used to gather and forward sensed information. However, besides intrinsic constraints on sensor nodes, they are vulnerable to a variety of security threats. This paper presents an energy-aware and secure multi-hop routing (ESMR) protocol by using a secret sharing scheme to increase the performance of energy efficiency with multi-hop data security against malicious actions. The proposed protocol comprises three main aspects. First, the network field is segmented into inner and outer zones based on the node location. Furthermore, in each zone, numerous clusters are generated on the basis of node neighborhood vicinity. Second, the data transmission from cluster heads in each zone towards the sink node is secured using the proposed efficient secret sharing scheme. In the end, the proposed solution evaluates the quantitative analysis of data links to minimize the routing disturbance. The presented work provides a lightweight solution with secure data routing in multi-hop approach for the IoT-based constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

Access control is a critical security mechanism to secure the IoT ecosystem which comprises cloud computing and edge computing services along with smart devices. Today major cloud and IoT service providers including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Azure utilize some customized forms of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model along with specific authorization policies enabled by policy-based access control models. To enable fine-grained access control and overcome limitations of existing access control models, there is an imminent need to develop a flexible and dynamic access control model for securing smart devices, data and resources in the cloud-enabled IoT architecture. In this paper, we develop a formal attribute-based access control (ABAC) model for AWS IoT by building upon and extending previously developed access control model for AWS IoT, known as AWS-IoTAC model. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model through an industrial IoT use case and its implementation in the AWS IoT platform.

Detecting these threat actions in early phases before the final stage of the attacks can be executed against industrial endpoints can help prevent adversaries from achieving their goals. Threat hunting in IT networks has been previously studied, and several hunting methods have been proposed. However, these methods are not sufficient for ICSs, as the integration of industrial legacy systems with advanced IT networks has introduced new types of vulnerabilities and changed the behaviour of attacks. The lack of a unified hunting solution for integrated IT and OT networks is the gap that is considered in our paper. The contribution of this paper is an ICS Threat Hunting Framework (ICS-THF) which focuses on detecting cyber threats against ICS devices in the earliest phases of the attack lifecycle. ICS-THF consists of three stages, threat hunting triggers, threat hunting, and cyber threat intelligence. The threat hunting trigger stage identifies events or external resources that can trigger the hunting stage. The hunting stage uses a combination of the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix and a Diamond model of intrusion analysis to generate a hunting hypothesis and to predict the future behaviour of the adversary. This hypothesis will be validated by analysing Diamond models of threat actions. Finally, the cyber threat intelligence stage is responsible for generating Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to be used for future threat hunting. The Black Energy 3 malware, PLC-Blaster malware, and SWaT dataset are used in this paper to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed framework.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3133260","Commonwealth of Australia and Cybersecurity Research Centre Limited; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9638634","Threat hunting;industrial control systems;Diamond model;MITRE ATT&CK;cyber threat intelligence","Integrated circuits;Diamond;Security;Ransomware;Industrial control;Analytical models;Internet","industrial control;invasive software","information technology;operational technology networks;OT networks;industrial legacy systems;advanced IT networks;ICS-THF;cyber threats;ICS devices;threat hunting trigger stage;hunting hypothesis;cyber threat intelligence stage;industrial control systems;ICS threat hunting framework;MITRE ATT& CK matrix;indicators of compromise;black energy 3 malware;PLC-blaster malware;SWaT dataset","","2","","48","CCBY","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although various database forensic methods such as log analysis and investigation model development have been studied, among the database forensic methods, recovering deleted data is a key technique in database investigation for DB tampering and anti-forensics. Previous studies mainly focused on transaction or journal log to recover deleted data, but if logs are set to be deleted periodically or logs containing critical evidence are overwritten by new logs, the log-based recovery method can not be used practically. For this reason, an engine-based recovery method that analyzes data file at a raw level has been also introduced. There is research to recover small-sized databases such as SQLite and EDB, but there is no prior work describing the structure of data file and technology to recover deleted data of large databases used by enterprises or large organizations. In this context, we investigate Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), which is one of the most used large databases. Our method focuses on a storage engine of MSSQL. Through analyzing the storage engine, we identify the internal structure of MSSQL data files and the storage mechanism. Based on these findings, a method to recover tables and records is presented by empirical examination. It is compatible with various versions of MSSQL because it accesses data at the raw level. Our proposed method is verified by a comparative experiment with forensic tools implemented to recover deleted MSSQL data. The experimental results show that our method recovers all deleted records from the unallocated area. It recovers all data types including multimedia data, called Large Objects (LOB) in the database field.

An Electronic shelf labels (ESL) system is becoming an attractive alternative for this task because of the dynamic-price-updating and customer's product-evaluation-display features. A common ESL system configuration in a retail store includes thousands of battery-powered ESL tags that are mostly connected wirelessly in a dense indoor environment. Raising the success ratio of wireless communication is essential for the system's viability due to its limited battery life.

In this sense, opinion dynamics poses a novel approach for the correlation of anomalies, which has been successfully applied to other network security domains. In this article, we aim to analyze its applicability in the IIoT from a technical point of view, by studying its deployment over different IIoT architectures and defining a common framework for the acquisition of data considering the computational constraints involved.

However, false data injection (FDI) attacks, as recently revealed, can circumvent BDD and insert any bias into the value of the estimated state. Continuous works on constructing and/or protecting power systems from such attacks have been done in recent years. This survey comprehensively overviews three major aspects: constructing FDI attacks; impacts of FDI attacks on electricity market; and defending against FDI attacks. Specifically, we first explore the problem of constructing FDI attacks, and further show their associated impacts on electricity market operations, from the adversary's point of view.

Specifically, the paper investigates the so-called critical parameters in a network model whose errors cannot be detected or estimated due to the lack of local measurement redundancy. Due to this property of critical parameters, it will be impossible to detect, identify and correct errors in these parameters. Given the fact that electricity market applications are heavily model-dependent, the locational marginal prices (LMPs) can be shown to be seriously distorted in the presence of critical parameter errors. Furthermore, if such errors are maliciously injected by adversaries, they will go undetected. Meanwhile, prices and revenues associated with power transactions may be strategically manipulated. An approach for quantifying the impact of critical parameters on the management of electricity markets is proposed. Conditions related to network topology and measurement configuration leading to the appearance of critical parameters are classified, and meter placement strategies for avoiding critical parameters are presented as well.

We show that the CCs are superior to other codes in most cases. However, the RS and CCs concatenated codes are good candidates, and the RS codes with larger symbol length are preferred for a longer packet.

It aims to learn a joint representation of the question–image pair for answer inference. Most of the existing methods focus on exploring the multi-modal correlation between the question and image to learn the joint representation. However, the answer-related information is not fully captured by these methods, which results that the learned representation is ineffective to reflect the answer of the question. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel model, i.e., adversarial learning with multi-modal attention (ALMA), for VQA. An adversarial learning-based framework is proposed to learn the joint representation to effectively reflect the answer-related information. Specifically, multi-modal attention with the Siamese similarity learning method is designed to build two embedding generators, i.e., question–image embedding and question–answer embedding. Then, adversarial learning is conducted as an interplay between the two embedding generators and an embedding discriminator. The generators have the purpose of generating two modality-invariant representations for the question–image and question–answer pairs, whereas the embedding discriminator aims to discriminate the two representations. Both the multi-modal attention module and the adversarial networks are integrated into an end-to-end unified framework to infer the answer. Experiments performed on three benchmark data sets confirm the favorable performance of ALMA compared with state-of-the-art approaches.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3016083","Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:4182037); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1636210,U1636211); Open Research Fund from the Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data(grant numbers:2019ORF01012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9174895","Adversarial learning;multi-modal attention;visual question answering (VQA)","Correlation;Semantics;Learning systems;Visualization;Generators;Task analysis;Knowledge discovery","data visualisation;image processing;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);question answering (information retrieval)","visual question answering;VQA;extensive research attention;question-image pair;answer inference;multimodal correlation;answer-related information;learned representation;adversarial learning-based framework;Siamese similarity learning method;modality-invariant representations;question-answer pairs;multimodal attention module;adversarial networks","","2","","55","IEEE","24 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This construction aggregates the public keys and provides a compact signature that is verified as a group, which realizes faster batch verification than confirming them individually. Furthermore, both the multisignature scale and the public key length are independent of the number of signers and attributes in this scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this M-ABS-KA scheme is the first multi-ABS protocol with an aggregated public key and fast batch verification. Based on the hardness of the computational Diffie–Hellman problem, it is formally proven that the proposal achieves unforgeability in the random oracle model and enjoys signer privacy. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in theoretical and experimental analyses with other related ABS schemes, and the results show that it is feasible and efficient in storage, bandwidth, and computational cost.

Network operators and cyber analysts need fast and scalable tools to help identify suspicious behavior that bypasses automated security systems, but operators do not want another automated tool with algorithms they do not trust. Experts need tools to augment their own domain expertise and to provide a contextual understanding of suspicious behavior to help them make decisions. In this paper we present Situ, a visual analytics system for discovering suspicious behavior in streaming network data. Situ provides a scalable solution that combines anomaly detection with information visualization. The system's visualizations enable operators to identify and investigate the most anomalous events and IP addresses, and the tool provides context to help operators understand why they are anomalous. Finally, operators need tools that can be integrated into their workflow and with their existing tools. This paper describes the Situ platform and its deployment in an operational network setting.

Cloud-Trust is used to assess the security level of four multi-tenant IaaS cloud architectures equipped with alternative cloud security controls. Results show the probability of CCS penetration (high value data compromise) is high if a minimal set of security controls are implemented. CCS penetration probability drops substantially if a cloud defense in depth security architecture is adopted that protects virtual machine (VM) images at rest, strengthens CSP and cloud tenant system administrator access controls, and which employs other network security controls to minimize cloud network surveillance and discovery of live VMs.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2415794","Institute of information and infrastructure protection (I3P); Department of Homeland Security (DHS); National Cyber Security Division; RAND Corporation; DHS(grant numbers:2006-CS-001-000001); Johns Hopkins University; Dartmouth University; Binghamton University (SUNY); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7072526","Cloud computing;cyber security;advanced persistent threats;security metrics;virtual machine (VM) isolation","Cloud computing;Servers;Computer architecture;Cryptography;Monitoring;Firewalls (computing)","cloud computing;security of data;virtual machines","cloud-trust;security assessment model;infrastructure as a service clouds;IaaS;advanced persistent threats;APT;cloud architecture reference model;high level security metrics;degree of confidentiality;degree of integrity;cloud service provider;CSP;CCS penetration;high value data compromise;cloud defense;depth security architecture;virtual machine images;live VM;network security controls","","62","","46","IEEE","30 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One key design challenge is the management of encryption keys. Traditionally, a large quantity of encryption keys have to be managed by the data owner, and an equally large number of keyword trapdoors must be sent to the cloud for the purpose of searching over the shared data, which are cumbersome in terms of secure communication and management. Recently, key-aggregate (searchable) encryption schemes have been introduced to alleviate the problem. However, they were only designed under the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponent assumption in the prior works. Lattice-based key-aggregate (searchable) encryption schemes are valuable, because they have security against quantum computing attacks, average-case to worse-case equivalence as well as simplicity and potential efficiency. Here we propose a key-aggregate encryption scheme and a key-aggregate searchable encryption scheme which are both based on a lattice problem (i.e., the Learning with Errors problem). Some key techniques are employed during the construction of the schemes. A basis delegation algorithm is designed to generate the aggregate key without increasing the lattice dimension. The encryption algorithms of the two schemes are trickily devised to make the encrypted files decryptable or searchable. To overcome the problem of general matrix multiplication failing to satisfy commutative law, a hash function is designed by using diagonalizable matrices to make the encrypted file decryptable and the trapdoor adjustable. We present the schemes’ correctness proof, formal security analysis as well as performance analysis, which confirm that they are provably secure and practically efficient. To the best of our knowledge, the former is the first lattice-based key-aggregate encryption scheme and the latter is the first lattice-based key-aggregate searchable encryption scheme. We also demonstrate their application to cloud storage for searchable group data sharing by combining the two schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2952163","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602025,61972017,61972018,61932014,U1636211,61170189); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2016QY04W0802,2017YFB1400702); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:4182033); National Cryptography Development Fund(grant numbers:MMJJ20180215); State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment(grant numbers:SKLSDE-2019ZX-17,SKLSDE-2016ZX-22); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8894101","Cloud storage;searchable data sharing;key-aggregate encryption;key-aggregate searchable encryption;lattice-based problem;the learning with errors problem","Encryption;Cloud computing;Aggregates;Search problems;Lattices","cloud computing;cryptography;matrix multiplication;quantum computing;storage management","cloud storage;encrypted data;encryption keys;lattice-based key-aggregate searchable encryption scheme;searchable group data sharing;basis delegation algorithm;quantum computing attacks;Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponent assumption;diagonalizable matrices","","6","","31","CCBY","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A real-life case study utilizing industrial SIS devices are presented to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. In contrast with other complex schemes commonly used for safety assessment, the proposed FRGM gives benefits such that it is straightforward in steps and resource-efficient while achieving the same safety function. While safety is aimed at protecting the systems from accidental failures to eliminate or minimize hazards, security is focused on protecting the systems from deliberate malicious attacks.

However, simultaneous VAS requests from a large number of mobile devices to a single server or a cluster in an internet-of-things (IoT) environment could result in an inefficient system, if these requests are handled one at a time as the present traditional cellular network scenario is. This will not only slow down the server's efficiency but also adversely impacts the performance of the network. The current (insecure) practice of transmitting user identity in plaintext also results in traceability. In this paper, we introduce the first known protocol designed to efficiently handle multiple VAS requests at one time, as well as ensuring the secure delivery of the services to a large number of requesting mobile users. The proposed batch verification protocol (BAS-VAS) is capable of authenticating multiple simultaneous requests received by a large number of mobile users. We demonstrate that the protocol preserves user privacy over the network. The provider's servers ensure the privacy of the requested service's priority by performing sorting over encrypted integer data. The simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed protocol is lightweight and efficient in terms of communication and computation overheads, protocol execution time, and batch and re-batch verification delay. Specifically, we perform batch and re-batch verification (after detecting and removing malicious requests from the batch) for multiple requests in order to improve the overall efficiency of the system, as well as discussing time, space and cost complexity analysis, along with the security proof of our protocol using Proverif.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2019.2940908","European Commission(grant numbers:PCIG11-GA-2012-321980); TENACE PRIN(grant numbers:20103P34XC); Italian MIUR, and by the Project “Tackling Mobile Malware with Innovative Machine Learning Techniques”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839535","Authentication;batch verification;mobile user;privacy preservation;value added service","Protocols;Authentication;Servers;Mobile handsets;Cryptography","authorisation;cellular radio;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;Internet;message authentication;mobile computing","BAS-VAS;novel secure protocol;value added service delivery;mobile devices;mobile operators;value-added services;mobile users;telecommunication industry revenue;simultaneous VAS requests;internet-of-things environment;traditional cellular network scenario;user identity;known protocol;multiple VAS requests;secure delivery;batch verification protocol;multiple simultaneous requests;user privacy;provider;requested service;protocol execution time;re-batch verification delay;malicious requests;multiple requests","","2","","55","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How to realize the layer division of association semantic by the hierarchy analysis of ALN is an important research topic. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a hierarchy-cutting model of association semantic. First, experiments of four types of keywords with different linking roles are conducted to discover the possible distribution law. Experimental results show that these keywords with association role reveal previous power-law distribution. Then, based on the discovered power-law distribution, up-cutting and down-cutting points are presented to divide the association semantic into three layers. At the same time, theories of the hierarchy-cutting model are presented. Finally, examples of current core topic and permanent topics belonging to a domain are given. The experiments show that hierarchy-cutting points have high accuracy.

In order to help researchers for building a common narrative about DT, we present an elaborated structure of DT, namely, spiral DT-framework. Furthermore, for a secure and reliable management of the DT data, we propose using the blockchain technology rather than cloud or fog. As the classical blockchain suffers from transaction confirmation delays and is vulnerable to the quantum attacks, therefore, we propose a new variant of blockchain, namely twinchain, which is quantum-resilient and offers immediate transaction confirmation.

However, standard Predictive Maintenance approaches assume the availability of sensor measurements, and the costs associated with adding sensors or remotely accessing sensor readings may discourage the development of such technologies. In this context, Alarm Forecasting can be very useful as it represents a low-cost alternative or helpful support to sensor-based Predictive Maintenance. In this work, we propose a new formulation for the Alarm Forecasting problem, framed as a multi-label classification task. We present a novel deep learning-based approach called FORMULA (alarm FORecasting in MUlti-LAbel setting). FORMULA leverages Transformer, a popular Neural Network architecture in the field of Natural Language Processing. To cope with alarm imbalance, we draw inspiration from Segmentation and Object Detection. Thus, FORMULA is trained by minimizing the Weighted Focal Loss, which turns out to be very effective in predicting rare alarms. These alarms, even if they are difficult to predict by nature, often are business-critical. We assess the proposed approach on a representative real-world problem from the packaging industry. In particular, we show that it outperforms not only classic multilabel techniques but also models based on recurrent neural networks. As regards the latter, the proposed approach also exhibits a lower computational burden, both in terms of training time and model size. To foster research in the field and reproducibility, we also publicly share the alarm logs dataset and the code used to perform the experiments. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>—This paper was motivated by the problem of monitoring equipment in the scenario of dairy products packaging, under the mild assumption that logs of the alarm generated by the packaging machines are available. This paper proposes an alarm forecasting algorithm. Its goal is to predict if any alarm will occur in the future, based only on past alarm logs. The limits of the considered future window can be defined arbitrarily, so there is enough time to perform corrective actions. Thus, the proposed approach aims to prevent unexpected downtime that would not only hinder productivity but also imply significant material waste. The proposed approach leverages methodologies from Natural Language Processing and Object Detection to deal with rare alarms that are often very informative in the industrial scenario. Besides, both the code and the real-world industrial datasets used to evaluate the methodology are available publicly. Currently, the proposed approach only uses alarm logs. Especially in the context of Industry 4.0, where many sensory data may be available, this is a limitation. Thus, the described approach might be extended by integrating alarm logs with sensory data. This integration is expected to improve the estimation of equipment health state. The results described in this paper may find application not only in the manufacturing sector but also in different areas such as Cyber Security, where log files keep activity records of each process performed.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2021.3127995","Regione Veneto Project VIrtualization and Remotization for Resilient and Efficient Manufacturing, Virtualizzazione e remotizzazione per una manifattura efficiente e resiliente (VIR2EM); Italian Minister for Education (MIUR) through the initiative “Departments of Excellence” (Law 232/2016); Statwolf Data Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627935","Alarm forecasting;deep learning;imbalanced classification;industrial IoT;Industry 40;multi-label classification;predictive maintenance","Forecasting;Predictive models;Codes;Monitoring;Deep learning;Task analysis;Predictive maintenance","","","","","","45","IEEE","29 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proves that the blockchain technology is also effective in securing the distributed control systems against the false data injection attack. A six-prosumer microgrid is tested with the implementation of the hierarchical blockchain system. The security of both the control system and energy trading system of the microgrid is ensured. Smart contracts are created to calculate the feedback measurements for the control system and execute the energy transactions. According to the hierarchical structure, the private blockchain with static nodes is implemented for the distributed control to match the sampling rate. A Proof-of-Authority based blockchain is utilized to support the energy trading.

Although operating systems and browsers manage the certificate trust list (CTL) of publicly-trusted root CAs for global users, locally-trusted root CAs still play an important role and it is difficult for a user to manage its CTL properly by itself. Meanwhile, the CRI access is inefficient, sometimes even unavailable, and causes privacy leakage. We revisit these problems by analyzing the TLS sessions within an organization. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to analyze CTL management and CRI access on the scale of medium-sized organizations. Based on the analysis, a locally-centralized design is proposed to manage the CTLs of all users by IT administrators and access the CRI services for all users, within an organization. We apply this design to desktop virtualization systems to demonstrate its applicability, and build vCertGuard with oVirt and KVM-QEMU. In vCertGuard, the CTLs of all virtual machines (VMs) are managed in the VM monitors (VMMs). In the CTL, the self-signed certificates of publicly-trusted root CAs are properly configured, while each locally-trusted certificate chain is specified one by one. vCertGuard accesses the CRI services for all VMs, and the downloaded CRI is cached and shared among VMs. Because most TLS servers are visited by multiple users of an organization, it reduces the cost of CRI access. Experimental results of the prototype system show that vCertGuard maintains the CTLs with a negligible overhead, and significantly improves the performance of CRI access.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2020.3035265","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0802100); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772518,62002011); Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2020-ZD-05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9246549","Public key infrastructure;trust management;certificate revocation;virtualization-based security","Servers;Organizations;Browsers;Virtual machine monitors;Virtualization;Privacy;Internet","authorisation;certification;data privacy;message authentication;online front-ends;operating systems (computers);public key cryptography;trusted computing;virtual machines;virtualisation","root certification authority;certificate revocation information;operating systems;certificate trust list;publicly-trusted root CAs;global users;locally-trusted root CAs;CRI access;CTL management;medium-sized organizations;locally-centralized design;CRI services;desktop virtualization systems;vCertGuard;virtual machines;certificate chain;downloaded CRI;multiple users;prototype system show;certificate validation","","5","","88","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, Lattice-reduction-aided Gibbs algorithm is proposed to sample from an equivalent lattice Gaussian distribution but with less correlated multivariate, thus leading to a better Markov mixing. After that, we extend the proposed lattice-reduction-aided Gibbs sampling to lattice decoding, where the choice of the standard deviation for the sampling is fully investigated. A customized solution that suits for each specific decoding case by Euclidean distance is given, which results in a better tradeoff between Markov mixing and sampler decoding. Based on it, a startup mechanism is also proposed for Gibbs sampler decoding, where decoding complexity can be reduced without performance loss.

For example, a number of existing schemes are designed based on symmetric bilinear pairing, which are computationally expensive. While certificate-based auditing schemes can simplify certificate management and mitigate key escrow concern, such schemes are not popular in the literature. Therefore, we propose a lightweight certificate-based public/private auditing scheme based on asymmetric bilinear pairing for cloud storage. Specifically, we describe a new method of designing lightweight auditing schemes. Additionally, our proposed scheme is proven to be secure in the random oracle model. We then implement our scheme by using type D curve of the pairing-based library. The findings demonstrate that our auditing scheme significantly reduces client's computation cost in the tag-generation (TagGen) phase, particularly in comparison to several other competing schemes. For example, when the block size is 10 KB, our on-line computation cost in the TagGen phase takes only 0.45 seconds, while it requires at least 62.83 seconds in other schemes. Furthermore, the findings show that when the number of blocks is fixed, the on-line computation cost in our TagGen phase is constant despite varying file sizes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960853","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1905211,61771140,U1405255,61702100); Fujian Province University Industry Cooperation of Major Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2017H6005); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M612107,2018T110636); Cloud Technology Endowed Professorship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936952","Certificate-based auditing;public/private auditing;lightweight;provable data possession;cloud storage","Cloud computing;Servers;Data integrity;Data models;Public key","auditing;certification;cloud computing;data integrity;data privacy;public key cryptography;storage management","asymmetric bilinear pairing;lightweight auditing schemes;pairing-based library;competing schemes;cloud storage services;secure public auditing scheme;symmetric bilinear pairing;certificate-based auditing schemes;lightweight certificate-based public/private auditing scheme;random oracle model;tag-generation;TagGen","","6","","40","CCBY","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the rapid development of communication technology, it becomes possible to process large amounts of video data and identify the driver's emotions in real time. To effectively recognize driver's emotions, this paper proposes a new deep learning framework called Convolution Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (CBLNN). This method predicts the driver's emotion based on the geometric features extracted from facial skin information and the heart rate extracted from changes in RGB components. The facial geometry features obtained by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are intermediate variables for the heart rate analysis of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Subsequently, the output of Bi-LSTM is used as input to the CNN module to extract the hear rate features. CBLNN uses Multi-modal factorized bilinear pooling (MFB) to fuse the extracted information and classifies it into five common emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear and neutrality. Our emotion recognition method was tested, proving that it can be used to quickly and steadily recognize emotions in real time.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3007357","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1700500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973126,61902147); Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:2017A030306015); Pearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou(grant numbers:201710010059); Guangdong Special Projects(grant numbers:2016TQ03X824); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019ZD27,21619312); Innovation Team of the Modern Agriculture Industry Technology System in Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019KJ139); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B010166006); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017B090914002); Scientific research project of Southwest Minzu University(grant numbers:2015NYB11); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144471","Emotion recognition;facial skin;heart rate;bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM);CBLNN","Heart rate;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Facial features;Brightness;Face","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);driver information systems;emotion recognition;face recognition;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image fusion;image retrieval;recurrent neural nets;road safety;road traffic;video signal processing","driver emotion recognition;emotion recognition method;convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory neural network;traffic safety;video data;CBLNN;geometric feature extraction;facial skin information;heart rate extraction;RGB components;multimodal factorized bilinear pooling;information extraction fusion;MFB pooling;Bi-LSTM;deep learning","","5","","37","IEEE","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rejected candidate by the acceptance mechanism is utilized as a learnable experience for the generation of a new candidate at the same Markov move. In this way, the overall probability of remaining the same state at the Markov chain is greatly reduced, which leads to an improved convergence performance in the sense of Peskun ordering. Moreover, in order to reduce the complexity cost during the Markov mixing, a symmetric sampling structure which greatly simplified the sampling operation is further introduced and the symmetric learnable delayed metropolis-within-Gibbs (SLDMWG) sampling algorithm is given.

This specific and important part of the whole supply-chain process was taken as suitable for the study due to almost full-automated line with data about each process activity of the value-stream in the information system. The paper applies process mining algorithms in discovering a descriptive process model that plays the main role as a basis for further analysis. At the same time, modern techniques of the bottleneck analysis are described, and two new comprehensible methods of bottlenecks detection (TimeLag and Confidence intervals methods), as well as their advantages, will be discussed.

We first consider an attacker who is able to mount several multi-stage attacks on the organization: the defender’s objective is to select an optimal portfolio of security controls, within a given budget, to withstand the highest number of attacks. The mathematical model is a Markov chain with an initial state called the safe state, intermediate states for all possible attacks (each attack state denoting a probabilistic attack graph), and a sink state denoting a successful attack. The overall defence problem is formulated as a bi-level multi-objective optimization, i.e., the defender selects an optimal portfolio of security controls to mitigate an optimal attacker. In order to determine the probability of success of an attack two cases will be considered: (a) the expected probability of success and (b) the highest probability of success. We refer to these two cases as expected-time analysis and worst-case time analysis, respectively. To solve precisely these bi-level optimizations strong duality and Mixed Integer Linear Programming are used. We then extend the framework to investigate resilience in terms of the total duration of the attacks; variations of the previous optimizations are presented to this purpose.

The IIoT is characterized by an increased degree of inter-connectivity, which not only creates opportunities for the industries that adopt it, but also for cyber-criminals. Indeed, IoT security currently represents one of the major obstacles that prevent the widespread adoption of IIoT technology.

As a response to the adversarial malware classification challenge organized by the MIT Lincoln Lab and associated with the AAAI-19 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS'2019), we propose six guiding principles to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks. Some of these principles have been scattered in the literature, but the others are introduced in this paper for the first time. Under the guidance of these six principles, we propose a defense framework to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial malware evasion attacks. By conducting experiments with the Drebin Android malware dataset, we show that the framework can achieve a 98.49% accuracy (on average) against grey-box attacks, where the attacker knows some information about the defense and the defender knows some information about the attack, and an 89.14% accuracy (on average) against the more capable white-box attacks, where the attacker knows everything about the defense and the defender knows some information about the attack. The framework wins the AICS'2019 challenge by achieving a 76.02% accuracy, where neither the attacker (i.e., the challenge organizer) knows the framework or defense nor we (the defender) know the attacks. This gap highlights the importance of knowing about the attack.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2021.3051354","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201706840123); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1804604,2020YFB1804600,2020YFB1805503); Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China; 2018 Jiangsu Province Major Technical Research Project Information Security Simulation System; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:30918012204,30920041112); Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:#1814825); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321695","Adversarial machine learning;adversarial malware detection;deep neural networks;malware classification","Malware;Training;Robustness;Perturbation methods;Neural networks;Harmonic analysis;Feature extraction","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","deep neural networks;machine learning-based malware detection;adversarial evasion attacks;adversarial malware classification challenge;defense framework;adversarial malware evasion attacks;Drebin Android malware dataset;grey-box attacks;white-box attacks;MIT Lincoln Lab","","7","","71","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper briefly introduces the fundamentals of blockchain technology, such as different types of blockchain networks and consensus mechanisms, in addition to introducing a few blockchain platforms that are widely used in current studies, projects, and startups or may have future potential in the electricity sector applications. The contribution of this paper is to provide a review of potential applications of blockchain in many electricity sector use cases, and they are categorized into eight categories such as P2P energy trading, wholesale markets, retail markets, metering and billing, trading of renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon credits, electric mobility, enhancement of power system cyber security, investments in renewable energy sources (RESs), and power system operation and management.

This, in turn, will demand real-time data analysis and processing from cloud computing platforms. A substantial part of the computing infrastructure is supported by large-scale and geographically distributed data centers (DCs). Nevertheless, these DCs impose a substantial cost in terms of rapidly growing energy consumption, which in turn adversely affects the environment. In this context, efficient resource utilization is seen as a potential candidate to enhance energy efficiency and minimize the load on the power sector. Nevertheless, in the majority of the public clouds, the resources are idle most of the time (i.e., under-utilized) as the load of the servers is unpredictable; thereby leading to a lofty increase in the energy utilization index and wastage of resources. Thus, it is highly essential to devise a precise and efficient resource management technique. Therefore, in this article, we leverage the advantages of software defined data centers (SDDCs) to minimize energy utilization levels. Precisely, SDDC refers to the process of programmatically abstracting the logical computing, network, and storage resources; and configuring them in real-time based on workload demands. In detail, we demonstrate the possibility of 1) designing a consolidated SDDC-based model to jointly optimize the process of virtual machine (VM) deployment and network bandwidth allocation for reduced energy consumption and guaranteed quality of service (QoS), particularly for heterogeneous computing infrastructures; 2) formulating a multiobjective optimization problem to deduce the optimal allocation of resources for both critical and noncritical applications; and 3) designing an efficient scheme based on heuristics to provide suboptimal results for the formulated multiobjective optimization problem. The proposed article presents a suboptimal approach based on first fit decreasing algorithm. Further, our empirical evaluations suggest that the proposed framework leads to almost 27.9% savings in terms of energy consumptions against the existing schemes with negligible QoS violations (approximately 0.33).","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2019.2939573","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Tier 2 Canada Research Chair on the Next Generations of Wireless IoT Networks; National Science Foundation; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure(grant numbers:1907821); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8825507","Big Data;cloud computing;energy minimization;Internet of Things;multiobjective optimization problem;prioritized scheduling;software defined data centers;and virtual machines","Quality of service;Switches;Data centers;Cloud computing;Software;Virtual machining;Internet of Things","bandwidth allocation;Big Data;cloud computing;computer centres;energy conservation;energy consumption;Internet of Things;optimisation;power aware computing;quality of service;resource allocation;virtual machines","Big Data-enabled consolidated framework;real-time data analysis;cloud computing platforms;computing infrastructure;substantial cost;energy efficiency;public clouds;energy utilization index;resource management technique;energy utilization levels;logical computing;storage resources;consolidated SDDC-based model;reduced energy consumption;heterogeneous computing;multiobjective optimization problem;energy consumptions;energy efficient software defined data centers","","44","","30","IEEE","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, IIoT devices are deployed in factories to help the manufacturing companies (e.g., automotive) gain in-depth insight into the various states of production, and thus improving production efficiency and achieving cost reductions. However, malicious code may compromise IIoT devices if either the devices are exposed to outside or unexposed inner devices are updated unauthentically. Due to their limited resources and features, it is challenging to implement strong security solutions for such embedded devices. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based software status monitoring system, called BoSMoS. The system is designed to monitor the software status of IIoT devices to detect and respond to identified malicious behaviors (e.g., intrusions). BoSMoS takes a snapshot of the statue of monitored software and monitors its file system calls. In order to ensure the software integrity information, we use blockchain as the distributed ledger to store a snapshot of software status. The blockchain network of BoSMoS can employ different consensus algorithms. We also evaluate the performance of BoSMoS, in terms of exception response delay, resistance performance to various intrusions, and scalability. The experimental results justify that BoSMoS is practical and sound. In addition, the evaluation of scalability and security demonstrates that the system can carry deployment of large-scale IIoT devices and can guarantee authenticated software updating, as well as detect unauthorized software status.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2947339","Major Scientific and Technological Special Project of Guizhou Province(grant numbers:20183001); Open Funding of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data(grant numbers:2018BDKFJJ009,2017BDKFJJ006); Open Funding of Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Intelligent Geo-Information Processing(grant numbers:KLIGIP2016A05); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8869742","Blockchain;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);software monitoring","Software;Blockchain;Monitoring;Security;Peer-to-peer computing;Internet of Things;Consensus algorithm","cost reduction;cryptography;Internet of Things","critical infrastructure sectors;manufacturing companies;production efficiency;cost reductions;unexposed inner devices;embedded devices;blockchain-based software status;monitored software;file system calls;software integrity information;blockchain network;large-scale IIoT devices;authenticated software updating;unauthorized software status;blockchain-based status monitoring system;BoSMoS","","23","","36","IEEE","16 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the prominent characteristics of these devices is to provide physicians with effective diagnosis of sensitive diseases. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a means of connecting medical devices to computing nodes with the help of Internet for affording real-time communications between patients and clinicians to understand the interaction of human protein complexes. A secure and correct protein complex prediction plays an important job in perceiving the principal method of various cellular determinations and to elucidate the functionality of different un-annotated proteins. Different experimental schemes have been evolved to accomplish this task, however, these schemes have high error rates and are not efficient in terms of time, cost, privacy, and security. To tackle these limitations, numerous computational models have been developed that consider a protein complex as a dense sub-graph and utilize some basic topological properties such as density and degree statistics as a feature set for protein complex prediction. Different kinds of sub-graph structures, e.g., ring, star, linear, and hybrid have also been found in Protein-Protein Interaction Network (PPIN), therefore, more advance topological properties may be helpful to predict these structures. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of protein determines its formation, thus, the sequence information is important for predicting the interacting property among proteins in a secure way. In this study, we have computed basic as well as advance topological features by considering the interaction network of human protein complexes in the IoMT environment. In addition, biological features, i.e., discrete wavelet coefficients, length, and entropy from amino acid sequences of proteins have been computed. The supervised learning method based on association rules such as Partial Tree (PART) and Non-Nested Generalized Exemplars (NNGE) are trained to identify human protein complexes on the basis of integrated topological and biological properties. The 10-fold cross validation is exercised to measure the proposed methods. Experimental results show that association rule learners with integrated features outperform other complex mining algorithms, i.e., probabilistic Bayesian Network (BN), and Random Forest, in terms of accuracy and efficiency in addition to provide privacy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963797","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949468","Discrete wavelet transform;NNGE;PPI;PART;privacy;security","Proteins;Amino acids;Feature extraction;Discrete wavelet transforms;Supervised learning;Privacy","data mining;diseases;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;molecular biophysics;proteins;trees (mathematics)","human protein complexes;protein complex prediction;un-annotated proteins;protein-protein interaction network;complex mining algorithms;IoMT-based association rule mining;Internet-enabling devices;medical devices;sensitive disease diagnosis;Internet of Medical Things;cellular determinations;sub-graph structures;amino acid sequence;supervised learning;association rules;partial tree;non-nested generalized exemplars;integrated topological property;biological property;10-fold cross validation","","10","","45","CCBY","3 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A possible packet sniffing location for organizations is an under control gateway between intranet and internet to inspect network traffic. However, when an intranet user uses an identity obfuscation protocol such as VPN or TOR, the packet IP and port would be rewritten to preserve user privacy. The same user's packet sniffed between a user and TOR entry node/VPN proxy always has the same 5-tuples (packets with the same source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and IP protocol defined as flow). Thus, we cannot rely on the 5-tuples rule to split traffic into flows. This challenge is called the “only one flow problem” and poses an obstacle for flow classification. A previous solution uses timeout value to determine flow separation points to address this issue. However, the predefined static time threshold cannot fit all user habits, which leads to separation errors. To overcome timeout limitations, we propose a flexible method called AI-FlowDet by leveraging the scene change concept and a CNN model to find behavior change points of traffic based on learning data. AI-FlowDet can apply to the traffic of the identity obfuscation protocols. Next, we propose 294 size-based and direction-based features that can be used with AI-FlowDet to evaluate flow type classification performance. Every experiment leverages different machine learning algorithms. The results show that AI-FlowDet with the proposed features can achieve 98.5% weighted accuracy, which is increased by 12.6% versus the previous timeout method with baseline features. We proved that the proposed splitting methods for the only one flow problem and proposed features for flow type classification are effective based on the good results obtained for both the VPN and TOR datasets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3087528","“5G Cyber Security Detection and Protection System Project (1/1)” of the Institute for Information Industry, Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 110-2634-F-002-037,110-2218-E-002-018-MBK); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448217","TOR;VPN;flow classification;AI-FlowDet;only one flow problem","Virtual private networks;Protocols;IP networks;Servers;Logic gates;Encryption;Feature extraction","computer network security;convolutional neural nets;cryptography;data privacy;Internet;intranets;telecommunication traffic;virtual private networks","flow problem;traffic classification;identity obfuscation environments;encrypted traffic;network flow classification;encrypted packet;network traffic;intranet user;identity obfuscation protocol;user privacy;source IP;destination IP;source port;destination port;IP protocol;flow separation;AI-FlowDet;flow type classification performance;packet sniffing location;CNN model","","","","31","CCBY","8 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, several researchers have addressed this obfuscation problem with obfuscation-invariant features. However, to the best of our knowledge, no researcher has utilized deobfuscation techniques. To this end, we adopt a code deobfuscation technique with an Android malware detection system and investigate its effects. Experimental results indicate that code deobfuscation can successfully retrieve useful information concealed by obfuscation. Further, we propose interaction terms based on identified feature interactions. The proposed interaction terms aim to eliminate the interference caused by the size of the application and other features because many feature values are correlated to the size of the application. In addition, the experimental results indicate that these interaction terms have a high ranking in terms of feature importance values.

Intelligent attackers can carefully design a destructive and stealthy false data injection attack (FDIA) sequence such that commonly used weighted least squares estimator combined with residual-based detection method is vulnerable to the FDIA. To effectively defend against an FDIA, in this paper, we propose a robust deviation-based detection method, in which an additional Kalman filter is introduced while retaining the original weighted least squares estimator, so that there are two state estimators. Moreover, an exponential weighting function is also applied to the introduced Kalman filter in our proposed method. When an FDIA occurs, the estimation results of weighted least squares estimator depend only on meter measurements at each time slot, but there is an adjustment process of estimated states for the Kalman filter based on historical states' transitions. Meanwhile, based on the exponential weighting function, estimated measurements in the Kalman filter can be adaptively suppressed for different attack strengths of FDIAs, and then the difference of the results of these two estimators increases. Subsequently, FDIAs can be effectively detected by checking the deviation of estimated measurements about the two estimators with a detection threshold. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed detection method against FDIAs. The impact of different attack strengths and noise on detection performance is also evaluated and analyzed.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3051155","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFE0101300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62022088); Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program(grant numbers:XLYC1902110); Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2020JH2/10500002,2019-YQ-09); International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:173321KYSB20180020,173321KYSB20200002); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9319848","State estimation;false data injection attacks;smart grid;cyber security;Kalman filter;cyber physical system","Phasor measurement units;Kalman filters;Smart grids;Power measurement;State estimation;Detectors;Weight measurement","computer network reliability;computer network security;Kalman filters;least squares approximations;power engineering computing;power meters;power system measurement;power system reliability;power system security;power system state estimation;signal detection;smart power grids","smart grid;intelligent attackers;residual-based detection method;robust deviation-based detection method;additional Kalman filter;original weighted least squares estimator;exponential weighting function;stealthy false data injection attack sequence;stealthy FDIA sequence;deviation-based detection method","","5","","35","CCBY","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Routing protocols have a significant impact on mesh networks because their performance has a crucial effect on nodes connectivity and throughput. Recently, the integration of mesh clients with the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant importance to connect billions of machines and achieve fast coverage with minimum network cost. However, if mesh clients are mobile, then data routing via intermediate nodes gives a noteworthy effect on the network performance and latency. Furthermore, over the Internet, a malicious node may be a part of the mesh network and as a result, the sending information can be manipulated and compromised. Therefore, this research article aims to propose a robust and trusted scheme (RTS) for IoT-based mobile mesh networks to provide reliable routing, data confidentiality, and integrity. Firstly, the proposed scheme presents a robust data routing among mobile mesh clients, routers and gateway devices based on the network parameters and measurement of wireless channels. Moreover, the wireless channels between mesh devices are formulated based on the efficacy of link costs for data dissemination. Besides, the location of mobile mesh clients is determined by computing the distance vector at a regular time interval. Secondly, a secure and authentic data protection technique is proposed using public-private key cryptography, which aims to increase the protection of mesh clients with minimal overhead. The competence of the proposed scheme is significantly improved with respect to network throughput by an average of 14%, packet loss rate by an average of 37%, latency rate by an average of 12%, computational overhead by an average of 34%, and energy efficiency by an average of 20% as compared to other works.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2985851","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University, through the Vice Deanship of Scientific Research Chairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057558","Wireless mesh network;the Internet of Things;data security;gateways;routing protocol","Routing;Wireless mesh networks;Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Wireless communication;Security;Reliability","computer network reliability;cryptographic protocols;Internet of Things;internetworking;mobile radio;network servers;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;routing protocols;wireless channels;wireless mesh networks","IoT-based mobile wireless mesh networks;minimum network cost;robust data routing;wireless channels;multihop model;routing protocols;Internet of Things;robust and trusted scheme;RTS scheme;data confidentiality;gateway devices;data dissemination;authentic data protection technique;public-private key cryptography;energy efficiency","","13","","58","CCBY","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, successfully attacking a CPS needs not only the knowledge of information technology (IT) but also the domain knowledge of the system's operation technology (OT). Therefore, it is critical to identify the vulnerabilities of a CPS. This paper proposes a systematic method for the security verification of a CPS, focusing on OT by using model checking with UPPAAL, so as to enhance cyber security. In our security analysis, we considered unsafe situations to be the result of a potentially effective security attack. Thus, we suggested a systematic method to generate security constraints based on the safety constraints (or safety checks) of the CPS and then enhance these security constraints by security verification using model checking with UPPAAL. UPPAAL's simulation tool can perform a detailed search for each state in various possible model combinations and can explore human-computer interactions more deeply. The contributions of our method are as follows: First, a systematic method is proposed to generate security constraints based on the overall safety requirements at the OT level. Second, the security constraints thus generated can be used for run-time monitoring to identify the possible security attacks when they are violated. Third, this paper proposes to augment normal system modeling with a suggested Attack Module to simulate the potential OT attacks. Finally, the verification results may be used in the following twofold directions: to identify the vulnerabilities for possible design improvements and to suggest the further additions of security constraints.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3081587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9434411","Cyber-physical systems;model checking;operation technology;security constraint;security verification;UPPAAL","Security;Tools;Model checking;Systematics;Monitoring;Cyber-physical systems;Computer crashes","formal verification;security of data","cyber security;cyber-physical system;OT attacks;normal system modeling;security attacks;model checking;security verification;CPS;security constraints;security analysis","","","","38","CCBYNCND","18 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve fine-grained access control in fog-enabled application scenarios to guarantee data security and user privacy, one could use ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE). However, the lack of an effective mechanism to carry out access right revocation in conventional CP-ABE schemes limits the deployment of such schemes in practice. Thus, we propose an efficient CP-ABE scheme with attribute revocation capability, designed to construct a fine-grained access control system in fog-enabled E-health (referred to as AC-FEH). In our AC-FEH system, fog nodes undertake data encryption and decryption operations; thus, computational costs for data owners and users are minimized. In comparison to several other competing access control schemes based on CP-ABE, our AC-FEH system reduces the computational costs associated with encryption and decryption. We also prove the selective security of the underlying CP-ABE scheme under the intractability assumption of the $q$ -parallel BDHE problem.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3052247","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62072184,61601129); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0802302); NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization(grant numbers:U1509219); Key Laboratory of Information Network Security of Ministry of Public Security (The Third Research Institute of Ministry of Public Security)(grant numbers:C18603); Shanghai Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:17ZR1408400); Cloud Technology Endowed Professorship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328126","Fog computing;access control;CP-ABE;outsourcing;attribute revocation;large universe","Access control;Cloud computing;Security;Encryption;Outsourcing;Edge computing;Servers","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;medical information systems;outsourcing","data encryption;decryption operations;computational costs;data owners;competing access control schemes;AC-FEH system;underlying CP-ABE scheme;efficient access control scheme;fog-enabled E-health;fog computing;data transfer;latency requirements;computational operations;cloud servers;fog-enabled application scenarios;data security;user privacy;ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption;access right revocation;attribute revocation capability;fine-grained access control system;fog nodes","","5","","45","CCBY","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The challenge is compounded in a cyber-physical system or cloud-based Internet of Things environment. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic search algorithm, which analyzes the program execution history and uses the refined history information to inform the search. This paper is based on the observation that the branch and input history generated during dynamic symbolic execution can help memorize the explored input space, and infer the partial structure of the program. With a summarized branch history, the proposed heuristic search makes informed (and better) decisions about which input area to search next for better efficiency. To evaluate the search algorithm, we implement the core DSE engine, integrated with modules to perform execution history collection and analysis. To make our method practical, we incorporate taint analysis and constraint solving statistics to guide the search algorithm.

While these “decision parameter”-focused approaches have been well accepted, they typically consider access control with centralized administration. Smart and collaborative computing systems (SCSs) such as online social networks, the Internet of Things (IoT) and connected cyber-physical systems (CPSs) require a disparate approach to meet their unique and complex access control requirements primarily because there are multiple participants who create, share, manage and protect resources (e.g., files, smart devices) individually, collaboratively or even competitively. A distinct feature of SCSs is the diffuse nature of control activities and their complex influence on other activities. Activity control (ACON) extends the scope of traditional access control models and considers how multiple administrative authorities (including users) can manage complex and interacting usage, service and control activities. In this paper, we articulate key characteristics and limitations of various existing access control models and highlight the significance and necessity of activity control in smart collaborative ecosystems. We then propose an extended ACON framework for catering to the needs of dynamic SCSs. Furthermore, we compare existing access control design principles and propose a set of activity control design principles for smart and collaborative computing systems.

Our approach can help manage the security risks by focusing on the critical activities performed in different microperimeters within an IoT system. The proposed architecture includes an organized process to understand the security requirements and select specific parameters for tailored security controls that are commensurate with organization-specific and application-specific security impacts of IoT.

Hence, we propose cryptographic protocols based on secure multiparty computation (SMC) to perform linear regression over EEG signals from many users in a fully privacy-preserving (PP) fashion, i.e., such that each individual's EEG signals are not revealed to anyone else. To illustrate the potential of our secure framework, we show how it allows estimating the drowsiness of drivers from their EEG signals as would be possible in the unencrypted case, and at a very reasonable computational cost.

Consequently, several SAT-resilient locking techniques, such as SARLock, Anti-SAT, and SFLL have been proposed, although certain instances of them have also been broken by a class of attacks, called removal attack. In this article, we approach logic locking by leveraging well-known principles from very large-scale integration (VLSI) testing and elicit logic locking properties that dictate the resilience of a locking technique against different attacks. We present a revised version of SFLL, namely SFLL-rem, that not only retains all security properties of SFLL, delivering resilience to all the state-of-the-art attacks SFLL can thwart, but also to the latest removal attacks that broke some SFLL instances. Further, we develop a security-aware CAD framework integrated with industry tools that incurs only -1.5%, 0%, and 4.13% overhead for power, performance, and area, respectively. We demonstrate a silicon implementation of SFLL-rem on ARM Cortex-M0 microprocessor in 65 nm. Moreover, we provide a framework for an SoC designer to customize logic locking based on the SoC blocks and their threat models; this is illustrated by locking a multimillion-gate SoC provided by DARPA, and taking the SoC all the way to GDSII layout.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2020.2968898","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) OMG Program; New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) Center for Cyber Security (CCS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8967131","ATPG;intellectual property (IP) piracy;logic locking;removal;SFLL","IP networks;Solid modeling;Resilience;Security;Tools;Silicon;Load modeling","industrial property;integrated circuit manufacture;logic CAD;microprocessor chips;system-on-chip;VLSI","logic locking;intellectual property piracy;Boolean satisfiability-based attack;SAT-resilient locking techniques;SFLL-rem;removal attacks;SFLL instances;stripping functionality;very large-scale integration;VLSI testing;intellectual property piracy;security-aware CAD framework;ARM Cortex-M0 microprocessor;SoC designer;DARPA;GDSII layout;IP piracy;SARLock;Anti-SAT;size 65.0 nm","","12","","41","IEEE","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional machine learning methods have been frequently used in the context of network security. However, such methods are more based on statistical features extracted from sources such as binaries, emails, and packet flows. On the other hand, recent years witnessed a phenomenal growth in computer vision mainly driven by the advances in the area of convolutional neural networks. At a glance, it is not trivial to see how computer vision methods are related to network security. Nonetheless, there is a significant amount of work that highlighted how methods from computer vision can be applied in network security for detecting attacks or building security solutions. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of such work under three topics; i) phishing attempt detection, ii) malware detection, and iii) traffic anomaly detection.

Accordingly, NPPs were regarded as safe from external cyber-attacks. However, it was later determined that isolated networks are not safe from cyber-attacks. Malicious data injection attacks on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) deployed in the safety system of NPPs are critical to nuclear facilities, as they were in the Stuxnet attack. It is necessary to monitor the integrity of PLC data and protect the PLCs from cyber threats such as modification of deployed logic or setpoints. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel system for monitoring data integrity of PLCs using blockchain technologies. Considering the NPP environment, we developed a private blockchain system to monitor the data integrity of PLCs. The new concept that is Proof of Monitoring (PoM) for data integrity of PLCs was proposed to overcome the limitation for applying the private blockchain to the cybersecurity of NPPs. Additionally, we developed an integrity monitoring system for the Reactor Protection System (RPS)-a safety system in NPPs-using the developed blockchain. It can detect cyber-attacks (such as false code injection attacks on PLCs) and monitor which PLC integrity has been compromised in real-time.

First, we propose a signature scheme based on lattice problem. We use lattice basis delegation algorithm to generate secret keys with selecting a random value, and sign message by preimage sampling algorithm. In addition, we design the first-signature and last-signature in our scheme, which are defined as double-signature. It is used to reduce the correlation between the message and the signature. Second, by combining the proposed signature scheme with blockchain, we construct the PQB and propose this cryptocurrency scheme. Its security can be reduced to the lattice short integer solution (SIS) problem. At last, through our analysis, the proposed cryptocurrency scheme is able to resist the quantum computing attack and its signature satisfies correctness and one-more unforgeability under the lattice SIS assumption. Furthermore, compared with previous signature schemes, the sizes of signature and secret keys are relatively shorter than that of others, which can decrease the computational complexity.

Consequently, this work aims to consider the IoE framework to investigate the peak load shifting problem in which end-users in the energy market can adopt their respective energy storage facilities to charge and discharge energy to minimize the total operating costs. In such a problem setting, each end-user can not only be a demander, but also be a supplier in the energy market, so that operating costs are concerned; the energies from both conventional electrical grids and distributed renewable energy sources can be stored in energy storage facilities; real-time price of energy will be applied adequately to affect energy distribution of supply and demand.

However, optimizing the security of demand response (DR) management with given energy states under IoE circumstance is rarely studied. Due to the connection to the Internet, the DR management in IoE faces a number of unique cyber-physical security challenges. First, as distributed energy resources have a large number of stakeholders and any illegal skip-level energy access may cause disastrous results, it requires fog computing paradigm to enforce a more secure DR management. Second, in the localized energy networks of IoE, a corrupt DR participator can maliciously read and write DR strategies by using collusion attacks (e.g., reputation-based cheating and unfair competing). To address these issues, we propose a fog computing-enabled secure demand response (FSDR) scheme for IoE against collusion attacks using consensus and access control encryption. In FSDR, the fog node was reconstructed as a sanitizer to randomly transfer encrypted energy states and DR strategies with homomorphic operations. Moreover, a simulated annealing-based consensus algorithm was presented to examine the validity of the energy states and DR strategies.

Over the last decade, however, processors for the IoT and IoE have improved; with increased operating power and memory resources, longer data bus widths and low-power consumption. With the improvements made to processors suitable for building IoT devices, the question remains whether endpoint nodes should still be considered capable of only supporting the most lightweight of cryptographic mechanisms. We evaluate the capabilities of a device family (Cortex-M series processors) commonly found in programmable logic controllers to implement standard, verified software cryptographic libraries in terms of execution times, memory occupation, and power consumption in order to determine their adequacy for use in smart grid applications. It was seen that the MCUs were easily capable of running standard cryptographic algorithms. However, the use of public key cryptography may still require the inclusion of a hardware crypto accelerator or the use of a secure MCU implementing public key cryptography; as the relatively long execution times seen during the operation of ECDSA, for example, could be intolerable within a real time IoE application.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2793301","Council for Scientific and Industrial Research(grant numbers:KR7SSMC); South African Mineral Extraction Research Development and Innovation Strategy Programme’s thematic area of Real Time Information Management Systems; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258990","Industrial Internet of Things;Internet of Energy;Embedded Security;Smart Grid","Smart grids;Cryptography;Internet;Pricing;Program processors;Smart meters","Internet of Things;microcontrollers;power consumption;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor nodes;securing new-generation Internet;software cryptography;secure MCU;public key cryptography;standard cryptographic algorithms;smart grid applications;memory occupation;programmable logic controllers;Cortex-M series processors;cryptographic mechanisms;endpoint nodes;IoT devices;low-power consumption;memory resources","","27","","35","OAPA","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, the familiarity of Ethernet and TCP/IP protocols and the diversity and success of attacks on them raises security risks and cyber threats for ICS. This issue is compounded by the absence of encryption, authorization, and authentication mechanisms due to the development of industrial communications protocols only for performance purposes. Recent zero-day attacks, such as Triton, Stuxnet, Havex, Dragonfly, and Blackenergy, as well as the Ukraine cyber-attack, are possible because of the vulnerabilities of the systems; these attacksare carried by the protocols used in communication between PLC and I/O units or HMI and engineering stations. It is evident that there is a need for robust solutions that detect and prevent protocol-based cyber threats. In this paper, machine learning methods are evaluated for anomaly detection, particularly for EtherCAT-based ICS. To the best of the author's knowledge, there has been no research focusing on machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection of EtherCAT. Before testing anomaly detection, an EtherCAT-based water level control system testbed was developed. Then, a total of 16 events were generated in four categories and applied on the testbed. The dataset created was used for anomaly detection. The results showed that the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and support vector machine with genetic algorithm (SVM GA) models perform best among the 18 techniques applied. In addition to detecting anomalies, the methods are able to flag the attack types better than other techniques and are applicable in EtherCAT networks. Also, the dataset and events can be used for further studies since it is difficult to obtain data for ICS due to its critical infrastructure and continuous real-time operation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960497","Sakarya Üniversitesi(grant numbers:2015-50-02-025); Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu(grant numbers:118E263); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936397","Anomaly detection;EtherCAT security;ICS security;machine learning for EtherCAT","Anomaly detection;Protocols;Machine learning;Integrated circuit modeling;Security;Level control","critical infrastructures;genetic algorithms;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);local area networks;production engineering computing;SCADA systems;support vector machines;transport protocols","zero-day attacks;Ukraine cyber-attack;protocol-based cyber threats;machine learning methods;EtherCAT-based ICS;machine learning algorithms;water level control system testbed;EtherCAT networks;EtherCAT-based anomaly detection;Ethernet-based protocols;industrial control systems communications;supervisory control;industrial communications protocols","","14","","39","CCBY","18 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The owner of a private key is provided with a public key certificate issued by a certificate authority (CA) representing a trusted third party. Although this certificate ensures the reliability of the ecosystem by verifying the data source and preventing the denial of trading, it often causes an overconcentration of trust in a particular CA. Consequently, if that CA is infringed, all the related trust relationships become compromised. The paper proposes a distributed authentication infrastructure called Meta-PKI that decentralizes such overconcentration via a cross-certification procedure performed by multiple CAs. Although cross-certification is capable of establishing mutual trust relationships, it does not evaluate the trustworthiness of other CAs in a standardized manner. Therefore, this paper also proposes a new cross-certification method using a distributed ledger technology for building trust relationships based on unified criteria. It also describes the implementation of a Meta-PKI system for Hyperledger Fabric as a proof of concept.

The high volumes of alerts generated by SGMS often confuse managers. Automatically handling alerts and extracting attack events is a critical issue for smart grid. Most of the existing security event analysis methods are designed for Internet, which will not be directly applicable to the power grid for high reliability and low attack tolerance requirements. In this paper, a multi-step attack detection model based on alerts of SGMS is proposed. In this model, an alert graph is constructed by IP correlation, and then transformed into candidate attack chains after being aggregated. Consequently, the candidate preliminary attack chains are pruned and denoised by negative causal correlation and non-cascading events. Finally, attack chains and visual attack graphs are formed. Our proposal model needs a little of priori knowledge while automatically extracting multi-step attack events and demonstrating the trajectories among IPs. The experimental results show the model performs well on China Grid data and DARPA 2000 data set.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2961517","Science and Technology Foundation of State Grid Corporation of China(grant numbers:521104180028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8938729","Smart grid security;alert correlation;multi-step attack;attack graph","IP networks;Smart grids;Security;Correlation;Monitoring;Buildings;Malware","graph theory;Internet;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;smart power grids","attack event extraction;security event analysis methods;China Grid data;proposal model;visual attack graphs;noncascading events;candidate preliminary attack chains;candidate attack chains;alert graph;low attack tolerance requirements;power grid;multistep attack detection model","","7","","34","CCBY","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Experimenting With Digital Signatures Over a DNP3 Protocol in a Multitenant Cloud-Based SCADA Architecture","M. Marian; A. Cusman; F. Stîngă; D. Ionică; D.

The first idea entails improving the security of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) architectures by means of asymmetric cryptography and digital signatures and measuring the performance overhead. This allows achieving some obvious subsequent goals such as data-origin authentication, and the traceability and implicit non-repudiation of commands given to intelligent field and direct control equipment. The possibility to include digital signatures with a minimum impact on a standard and a reliable data communication protocol, such as Distributed Network Protocol version 3 (DNP3), also known to have a mature, industrially validated, open-source implementation, has been tested and the results are presented. A second idea concerns designing and developing a multitenant cloud-based architecture for a SCADA environment. This hypothesis focuses on certain SCADA operators that manage multiple industrial control systems (ICS) and intend to consolidate process data in a centralized manner.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019112","European Regional Development Fund, Competitiveness Operational Program, under Grant TISIPRO(grant numbers:P_40_416/105736 (2016–2021)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9174980","Digital signatures;cybersecurity;SCADA;industrial control system;cloud-based services","Protocols;Cloud computing;Authentication;Digital signatures;Computer architecture","cloud computing;cryptography;data communication;digital signatures;protocols;SCADA systems","process data;multiple industrial control systems;SCADA operators;SCADA environment;multitenant cloud-based architecture;Distributed Network Protocol version;reliable data communication protocol;direct control equipment;data-origin authentication;performance overhead;asymmetric cryptography;supervisory control;multitenant cloud-based SCADA architecture;DNP3 protocol;digital signatures","","4","","44","CCBY","24 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Secure Association Rule Mining on Vertically Partitioned Data Using Private-Set Intersection","K. Nomura; Y. Shiraishi; M. Mohri; M.

Among the many available data-mining algorithms, association rule mining (ARM) is very common. It was developed to aggregate all data into one site and subsequently mine them. In recent years, organizations in different fields have been required to collaborate to create new value. However, data mining among and within organizations has raised privacy and confidentiality concerns. In our scheme, parties cannot share anything other than the number of records, including the candidate itemset. This study focuses on the private-set intersection instead of the scalar product and shows that this intersection enables organizations to execute ARM on vertically partitioned data, allowing flexible information sharing while preserving privacy without increasing communication and computation costs. Furthermore, we focus on the fact that the number of protocol rounds among parties can be reduced and present three use cases in which the proposed scheme works more effectively than the existing schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3014330","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:JP19K11963,JP18K04133); Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, Japan Science and Technology Agency(grant numbers:JPMJCR19F6); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159575","Privacy preserving;association rules mining;association rule hiding;frequent itemsets;private set intersection","Itemsets;Data privacy;Cloud computing;Distributed databases;Outsourcing;Organizations","data mining;data privacy","information sharing;scalar product;candidate itemset;ARM;secure association rule mining;vertically partitioned data;private-set intersection;data-mining algorithms;reusable knowledge","","2","","49","CCBY","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
